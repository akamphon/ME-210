\chapter*{Preface}

Thiss reading material is intended for the use in ME210: Mechanics of Materials, both as a teaching and study material. The materials extend those covered in CE202: Engineering Mechanics--Statics by going into more in-depth details, using more rigorous methods, and exploring more advanced case studies.

The topics included in these materials are the review of basic concept of stress-strain, member under axial loads, and member under torsion. However, in each of these, the topics covered will include analysis of composite materials under these loads. Furthermore, analysis of stress transformation will be explained. This will form a basis for the next topic: analysis of member under combined loadings. Finally, the topics will introduce the theories of failure--fracture and yield, fatigue, and buckling.

\chapter{Basic Mechanics of Materials Review}
The main interest in engineering mechanics of solids is to study the internal resistance of a body under externally applied forces. In earlier statics or dynamics courses, we study the effect of forces on rigid bodies. We may study how they move or how the forces distribute among many members of a structure, but we never study how the force affects each member. In reality, most bodies are deformable, the degrees of which depends on their material properties. In this case, we can still use the equation of equilibrium to determine the internal force acting inside the body.

$$ \sum F = 0 $$
$$ \sum M = 0 $$

\section{General Concepts of Load}

Considering a surface cutting through the body, there can be 2 types of forces and 2 types of moments acting on the surface

\begin{itemize}
\item Normal force ($F$) acts perpendicular to the surface. This force is developed when there is an external loads pushing or pulling on the surface of the body.
\item Shear force ($V$) acts in the plane of the surface. It developed when the external forces tends to cause the surface to slide sideways.
\item Torsional moment or torque ($T$) is developed when the loads tend to twist the segment with respect to another.
\item Bending moment ($M$) is developed when the loads tend to bend the body about an axis lying within the plane of the surface.
\end{itemize}

\section{Stress}

By definition, stress is the force per unit cross sectional area that it is acting upon. There are two types of stress, depending on the direction the force is acting on the surface

\begin{enumerate}

\item Normal stress: force per unit area acting normal to the surface. It can be expressed mathematically as

\begin{equation}
\sigma  = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \frac{F}{A}
\end{equation}

\item Shear stress: force per unit area acting tangent to the surface. This component can be expressed mathematically as

  \begin{equation}
    \tau  = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \frac{V}{A}
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

In the case of shear stress, we can further specify the direction of stress into rectangular components using $x$, $y$, $z$ coordinate axes, with $x$ and $y$ axes in the direction of the in-plane surface and $z$ axis normal to the surface. We can now express the normal stress components as

\begin{equation}
  \sigma _{zz} = {\sigma _z} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \frac{{{F_z}}}{A}
\end{equation}

and the two shear stress components as

\begin{equation}
  \arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{2.2}
  \begin{array}{l}
    {\tau _{zx}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \dfrac{F_x}{A} \\
    {\tau _{zy}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{A \to 0} \dfrac{F_y}{A}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Equilibrium Requirement}

Consider an infinitesimal cubic element, illustrated in \cref{fig: 3d-stress-element}, with external forces applied, each of the six faces of the cube will have three components of stress acting on it. If the stress around the point is constant, then we can use equilibrium equation to relate some of the stress components.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/3d-element-stress}
  \caption{Stresses on a three-dimensional element when considering a static equilibrium}
  \label{fig: 3d-stress-element}
\end{figure}
  
\paragraph{Normal Stress Components}

If we apply the equation of force equilibrium in the $x$ direction, then

\begin{equation}
  \arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{1.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    {\sigma _x}(\Delta y\Delta z) + \sigma_x'(\Delta y\Delta z) = 0\\
    {\sigma _x} =  - \sigma_x'
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

We can similarly prove that $\sigma_y = \sigma_{y’}$ and $\sigma_z = \sigma_z’$. Therefore, for a constant state of stress, each of the three normal stress components must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

\paragraph{Shear Stress Components}

In similar fashion, the shear stresses on opposite faces are of the same magnitude but in opposite direction.
The force equilibrium in the $x$ direction gives

\begin{equation}
  \arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{1.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    {\tau _{yx}}(\Delta y\Delta z) + {\tau_{yx}'}(\Delta y\Delta z) = 0\\
    {\tau _{yx}} =  - {\tau_{yx}'}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

If we consider a pair of shear stresses loading on the element, the moment equilibrium about the z direction gives

\begin{equation}
  \arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{1.5}
  \begin{array}{c}
    {\tau _{xy}}(\Delta y\Delta z)\Delta x - {\tau _{yx}}(\Delta x\Delta z)\Delta y = 0\\
    {\tau _{xy}} = {\tau _{yx}}
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

\section{Strain}

In order to describe deformation by changes in the length or by the changes in angles of the element, we will need to develop the concept of strain. As in stresses, there are two types of strain.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[fill=Grey] (-1,-1) rectangle (0,2);
    \draw[fill=SkyBlue] (0,0) rectangle (5,1);
    \draw[fill=SkyBlue, fill opacity=0.5, dashed] (0,0.1) rectangle (5.5,0.9);
    \draw[->,ultra thick] (5.5,0.5) -- (6.5,0.5) node[right]{$F$};
    \draw[<->] (0,-0.5) -- (2.5,-0.5) node[above]{$s$} -- (5,-0.5);
    \draw[<->] (0,-1) -- (3,-1) node[above]{$s'$} -- (5.5,-1);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Element elongation under tensile normal strain.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Normal strain} The change in the length of a line segment per unit length, whether elongation or contraction, is called normal strain. For example, consider the line AB which is contained within an undeformed body with length $s$. During its deformation, points A and B move to point A’ and B’ and the line becomes a curve having the length $s’$. The average normal strain becomes

\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon _{avg} = \frac{s' - s}{s}
\end{equation}

If the normal strain is known, we can use this equation to find the final length of the line segment after it is deformed. We have

\begin{equation}
  s' = (1 + \varepsilon _{avg})s
\end{equation}

Therefore, strain is positive when the line elongates and is negative when the line contracts.

\paragraph{Shear Strain} The change in angle that occurs between two line segments that were originally perpendicular is referred to as shear strain. This angle is denoted by and is measured in radians. Consider the same cubic element with shear stress couple applied in the $xy$-plane. The angle made by the original $x$ and $y$ axes is $90\degree$. After the deformation, the angle is changed by $\theta$. The shear strain in the plane, $\gamma_{xy}$, can be defined as 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/3d-shear-deformation}
  \caption{3-dimensional element under shear deformation.}
  \label{fig: 3d shear deformation}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
  {\gamma _{xy}} = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{y \to 0} \frac{{dx}}{y} = \tan \theta  \approx \theta
\end{equation}
 
\paragraph{Cartesian Strain Components}

Using the above definition of normal and shear strains, we will now show how it can be used to describe the deformation in a body. Consider an infinitesimal element of dimension that is located near a point in the body. The deformed shape of the element is a parallelepiped, assuming that very small line segments will remain relatively straight after the deformation. The approximate lengths of the sides of the parallelepiped are  $(1 + {\varepsilon _x})\Delta x$, $(1 + {\varepsilon _y})\Delta y$, and $(1 + {\varepsilon _z})\Delta z$ and the approximate angles between the sides are $(\pi /2) - {\gamma _{xy}}$, $(\pi /2) - {\gamma _{yz}}$, and $(\pi /2) - {\gamma _{zx}}$. Notice that the normal strains cause a change in the volume of the element, while the shear strains cause a change in its shape.

\section{Mechanical Properties of Materials}

\subsection{Tension and Compression Test}

Material behaviors must be determined by experiment. In order to understand how a material responds to external loads, one of the most important tests is the \emph{tension or compression test}. Though many properties of a material can be determined by this test, it is mainly used to determine the relationship between the average stress and average strain of a material.

To perform a tension or compression test, a specimen of the material is made into a standard shape and size--typically a cylinder with enlardged ends to ensure failure will occur along the middle of its length. Measurements are taken of both its initial cross sectional area and length. The specimen is then mounted on a test machine which is used to stretch the material until it fails. During the test, the machine takes frequent records of the applied load and the elongation of the specimen.

\subsection{Stress-Strain Diagram}

In order to for the load and deformation response from the tension or compression test to be universally useful, not just for the tested specimen cross-sectional area and length, we must normalize the applied force and deformation of the specimen. We can do so by dividing the applied force with the specimen cross-sectional area, and dividing the deformation by its original length, giving us a stress-strain diagram (rather than a force-deformation diagram).

While the actual stress-strain diagrams of different materials can be vastly different, we may discuss some of their common characteristics, illustrated in \cref{fig: stress-strain diagram}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{pictures/Basic-material-behavior/stress-strain-diagram}
  \caption{A general stress-strain diagram obtained from a tensile test.}
  \label{fig: stress-strain diagram}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Elastic Behavior:} occurs when the stress-strain relationship remains linear, where the strain is still in the green region. The upper lilmit stress of this linear relationship is called the \emph{proportionality limit}, $\sigma_{pl}$. If the applied stress exceeds this value, the curve no longer remains linear and usually curves down and flattens out. This continues until the \emph{elastic limit} below which any deformation occured due to this stress disappears when the stress is removed. For most materials, this elastic limit can be difficult to determine and distinguish from the proportionality limit.

\paragraph{Yielding:} Just beyond the elastic limit is the stress that will cause a permanent deformation in the specimen, also called the \emph{yield stress}, $S_y$. The permanent deformation that occurs is called \emph{plastic deformation}. During this period, the specimen will continue to elongate without any increase in the load. This is referred to as being \emph{perfectly plastic}.

\paragraph{Strain Hardening:} After yielding has ended, additional load can be supported by the specimen although the slope of the stress-strain diagram will decrease until it reaches the maximum stress, referred to as the \emph{ultimate stress}, $S_{ut}$. The rise in the curve after yielding is called \emph{strain hardening} and is denoted by the area in light brown.

\paragraph{Necking:} After yielding, the cross-sectional area of the specimen will continue to decrease, albeit uniformly throughout. However, when the stress is close the ultimate stress, the decrease in cross section will become localized as the specimen continues to elongate. The stress-strain curve beyond the ultimate stress usually curves downward, finally reaching the \emph{fracture stress}, $S_f$, when the specimen completely separates.

\subsection{Ductile and Brittle Materials}

Materials can be categorized as either ductile or brittle, depending on their stress-strain characteristics.

\subsubsection{Ductile Materials}

Materials that can withstand large amount of strains before fracture are called \emph{ductile materials}. Ductile materials are typically the materials of choice for component design because they are capable of absorbing shock and energy. Even if they are loaded excessively, they will undergo large deformation before failure.

One method of defining the ductility of a material is by reporting its elongation at failure, for which the formula is

\begin{equation}
  \text{\% elongation} = \frac{L_f - L_0}{L_0} \times 100\%
\end{equation}

For typical mild steel specimen, this value is around 38\%.

Another indicator of material ductility is its cross-sectional area reduction percentage at failure, for which the formula is

\begin{equation}
  \text{\% reduction of area} = \frac{A_0 - A_f}{A_0} \times 100\%
\end{equation}

Mild steel typically has a typical reduction of area at 60\%.

It is important to note that, beside steel, most ductile materials do not yield at constant loads. This makes defining an actual yield stress difficult. In this case, the yield stress can be obtained by the \emph{offset method} in which a line parallel to the elastic region of the stress-strain curve of a material is drawn from where strain is equal to 0.2\%. The point where this line intersects with the curve is defined as the yield stress.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Typical stress-strain curves for ductile and brittle materials.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Brittle Materials}

Materials that shows very small or no yielding at all before failure is called \emph{brittle materials}. Grey cast iron is the usual example.

Brittle materials in general shows much higher resistance to compressive loading than tensile loading. Concrete, another typical brittle material, has the maximum tensile strength of only 2.8 MPa, but has the maximum compressive strength of 35 MPa.

In general it can be said that most materials can exhibit both ductile and brittle behavior. At high carbon content or very low temperature, steel tends to become more brittle. At higher temperature, most brittle materials become more ductile.

\subsection{Hooke’s Law in One Dimension}

Since the stress-strain relationship for most engineering materials exhibit a linear relationship between stress and strain within the elastic regime, an increase in stress causes a proportional increase in strain. This fact was discovered by Robert Hooke in 1676 and is known as Hooke’s law. It can be expressed mathematically as

\begin{equation}
  \sigma  = E\varepsilon
\end{equation}

Here $E$ represents the constant of proportionality, which is called the modulus of elasticity or Young’s modulus.

\subsection{Poisson’s Ratio}

When a deformable body is subjected to an axial tensile force, not only does it elongate but it also contracts laterally. A French scientist S. D. Poisson found that the ratio between lateral and the longitudinal strains are always constant in the elastic regime. This constant is referred to as Poisson’s ratio, $\nu$, defined as

\begin{equation}
  \nu  =  - \frac{\varepsilon _{lat}}{\varepsilon _{long}}
\end{equation}
  
Notice the negative sign here since longitudinal elongation causes lateral contraction, and vice versa, as illustrated in \cref{fig: poisson's ratio}. Poisson’s ratio has no unit, or dimensionless, and for most nonporous material it has a value between 0.25 and 0.33.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The effect of Poisson's ratio in an element under uniaxial loading.}
  \label{fig: poisson's ratio}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
A thin rubber sheet of material with dimension 2 m x 4 m ($W \times L$) has $E$ = 200 MPa. A normal stress of 20 MPa is applied along the width of the sheet. What is the change in area of the material once the stress is applied. Assume the material has $\nu$ = 0.25
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
To determine the change in area, we need to find the dimension of the length and width of the sheet after the application of stress. First, we have to determine the strain in the longitudinal direction by applying Hooke’s law, from which we have

\begin{align*}
  \sigma _{long} &= E{\varepsilon _{long}} \\
  \varepsilon _{long} &= \frac{20 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}}{200 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}} = 0.1
\end{align*}	

From the strain, we can calculate the final length by

\[{L_f} = (1 + {\varepsilon _{long}}){L} = (1 + 0.1)4 = 2.2 \text{ m}\]

We can find the transversal strain by using the Poisson’s ratio and calculate the final width by

\begin{align*}
  W_{f} = (1 + {\varepsilon _{width}})W & = (1 - \nu {\varepsilon _{long}})W \\ 
                                        & = (1 - (0.25)(0.1))(4) \\ 
                                        &= 3.9 \text{ m} 
\end{align*}

Therefore, the total area change is

\[\begin{gathered}
  \Delta A = (2.2)(3.9) - (2)(4) \\ 
   = 0.58 \text{ m}^2 \\ 
\end{gathered} \]
\end{solution}
	
\subsection{Shear stress-shear strain relationship}

Much like the way there is a relationship between normal stress and normal strain in most engineering materials, shear stress and shear strain are also related linearly by the equation

\begin{equation}
  \tau  = G\gamma
\end{equation}

$G$ is called the shear modulus of elasticity and has the same unit as Young’s modulus

\section{Thermal effect}

A change in temperature can cause a material to change its dimensions. If the temperature increases, generally a material expands, whereas if the temperature decreases, the material will contract. Ordinarily this expansion or contraction is linearly related to the temperature increase or decrease that occurs. If the material is homogeneous and isotropic, it has been found that the deformation of a part having length $L$ can be calculated using the formula

\begin{equation}
  \delta _T = \alpha \Delta TL
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is a property of a material, referred to as the linear coefficient of thermal expansion, measuring strain per degree temperature, $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature of the part, $L$ is the original length of the member, and $\delta T$ is the change in length of the part.
However, if the change in temperature varies throughout the length of the part so that or if varies along the length, then the equation becomes

\begin{equation}
  \delta _T = \int_0^L \alpha \Delta Tdx
\end{equation}

Without any constraint, the change in length of the part can be computed using the given equations. However, if the expansion or contraction is restrained by supports, it will produce thermal stress in the part because it cannot deform freely.

\begin{example}
  
  A rubber bar of original length $L$ is stretched and glued between two walls. After that the bar is heated from its initial temperature $T_0$ to $T$ at which point there is no longer any remaining stress inside the bar. What is the distance between the two walls? Assume the material has modulus of elasticity $E$ and coefficient of thermal expansion $\alpha$.

      \draw (0,0.5) node{$T_0 \rightarrow T$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}
  
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
  Assume the distance between the two walls is $D$. Since there is no stress in the bar, which means thermal expansion has caused the bar to expand from original length $L$ to length $D$. Therefore,
  
\[\begin{gathered}
  D - L = \alpha (T - {T_0})L \hfill \\
  D = L[1 + \alpha (T - {T_0})] \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}\]
	
\end{solution}

\section*{Summary}

In this chapter, we have learned that bodies are deformable, the degree of which depends on the external loads and their material properties. We have learned that external loads have different effect on deformable bodies depending on their direction and surfaces they act upon. The deformations in the materials have been defined. We have established the relationship between the external load and the deformation by the Young’s and shear moduli. We have also learned that materials deform in a lateral direction as well when axial load is applied, which depends on the material’s Poisson’s ratio. Finally, we have learned that bodies can also deform due to the change in temperature.

\chapter{Analysis of Axially Loaded Members}

Structural components subjected only to tension or compression are known as axially loaded members. We can think of multiple types of such structures, for example, solid bars with straight longitudinal axes which can withstand both compression and tension, or cables, which can only withstand tension. The stress-strain behavior of such members was already discussed in Chapter 1, where we also obtained equations for the stresses acting on cross sections and the strains in longitudinal directions.

In this chapter we consider several other aspects of axially loaded members, beginning with the determination of changes in lengths caused by loads. The calculation for changes in lengths is also important in the analysis of structures whose stresses cannot simply be determined from the loads alone (statically indeterminate structures). We will then also discuss the effect of temperature change to the deformation of axially loaded members.


\section{Statically Determinate Systems}

Structures whose stresses and deformations can be analyzed simply by considering the applied loads are referred to as statically determinate systems. To analyze structures that fall into this category, we have to draw free body diagrams and use the equilibrium equation to determine the internal forces in the cross sections of interest, which would then lead to the stresses in the cross sections. In Chapter 1 we have already discussed the relationship between the internal forces and the stresses and its relationship with strain. We will now discuss the relationship between the deformation of axially loaded members (change in length) and the applied loads.

\subsection{Changes in Length of Axially Loaded Members}

When determining the changes in length of axially loaded members, it is convenient to begin with a coil spring. When a load is applied along the axis of a spring, the spring gets shorter or longer depending on the direction of the load.
Similarly, in the case of axially loaded members, they elongate or shorten depend on the direction of the load. If the load acts toward the member, it is in compression. If the load acts away from the member, it is in tension. It is also important to note its natural length L, also called its free length or relaxed length. Once the member is loaded, supposedly in tension, it will lengthen by an amount $\delta$ and its final length becomes $L + \delta$. If the material of the spring is linearly elastic, the load and elongation will be proportional, following Hooke’s law that

\end{figure}

\[\arraycolsep=1.4pt\def\arraystretch{2.2}
  \begin{array}{l}
    \sigma  = \dfrac{P}{A}\\
    \varepsilon  = \dfrac{\delta }{L}\\
    \sigma  = E\varepsilon 
  \end{array}\]

And therefore we can derive for these relationships that

\begin{equation}
  \delta  = \frac{PL}{AE}
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the elongation is directly proportional to the load $P$ and the member length $L$, and inversely proportional to the modulus of elasticity $E$ and the cross-sectional area $A$. This equation works assuming that the bar has a uniform cross section.

\subsection{Change in Length of Nonuniform Members}

However, if the bar is loaded by different axial loads, bar made of different materials, or its cross sectional area varies throughout its length, the stress throughout the bar varies. To solve for the total change in length of this type of problem, we must 1) identify the segments of the bar, 2) determine the axial forces in the segments from the free body diagrams, 3) applies the equation to all segments. The total change in length is the sum of the changes in length in all segments, or

\end{equation}

In which $i$ is the index of various segments of the bar and $n$ is the total number of segments. Note that the force $P_i$ is the internal axial force in the segment $i$, not the external force.

Some other times, the axial force $P$ and the cross-sectional area $A$ vary continuously along the axis of a bar. In this case, instead of using an algebraic sum, we must integrate the small changes along the length of a bar to calculate the total change in length.

Consider a small slither of the bar that has length $dx$ and cross-sectional area $A(x)$ locating at a distance $x$ from one end of the bar. Assume the internal force acting on the slither of the bar follows the function $P(x)$. The change in length of the slither is simply

  \caption{Deformation of a axially loaded constant cross-sectioned member.}
\end{figure}

  \[d\delta  = \frac{{P(x)dx}}{{EA(x)}}\]

And the total elongation of the entire bar is

\begin{equation}
  \delta  = \int_0^L {d\delta }  = \int_0^L {\frac{{P(x)dx}}{{EA(x)}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{example}
  A cylinder with continuously variable cross sections of length $L$ is supported at end A and subjected to a tensile load $P$ at the free end B. The radii of the bar at ends A and B are $r_A$ and $r_B$ respectively. Determine the elongation of the bar due to the load $P$.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pictures/Axial-load/axial-load-cone}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  From the equation
  
\[\delta  = \int_0^L {d\delta }  = \int_0^L {\frac{{P(x)dx}}{{EA(x)}}} \]

We know that the load is constant throughout the length of the cylinder. The only thing varying is the diameter of the cross section. Therefore, we will write the diameter as a function of length.
First to simplify the expression for the integral, we set the origin of the $x$ coordinate by extending the sides of the tapered bar until they meet at point O.
The distance $L_A$ and $L_B$ from the origin O to ends A and B respectively are in the ratio

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pictures/Axial-load/axial-load-cone-mod}
\end{figure}

\[\frac{{{L_A}}}{{{L_B}}} = \frac{{{r_A}}}{{{r_B}}}\]	

Using similar triangles, we have that the radius $r(x)$ at the distance $x$ from the origin to the radius $r_A$ at the small end of the bar is

\[\frac{{r(x)}}{{{r_A}}} = \frac{x}{{{L_A}}}\;\;\;{\text{or}}\;\;\;r(x) = \frac{{{r_A}x}}{L}\]	

Therefore, the cross-sectional area at distance $x$ from the origin is

\[A(x) = \pi [r(x)]^2 = \frac{{\pi r_A^2{x^2}}}{{L_A^2}}\]

The change in length is, thus,

\[\delta  = \int_{{L_A}}^{{L_B}} {\frac{{Pdx(L_A^2)}}{{E\pi r_A^2{x^2}}}} \]

Performing the integration, we have

\[\delta  = \frac{{PL_A^2}}{{E\pi r_A^2}}\left[ { - \frac{1}{x}} \right]_{{L_A}}^{{L_B}} = \frac{{PL_A^2}}{{E\pi r_A^2}}\left( {\frac{1}{{{L_A}}} - \frac{1}{{{L_B}}}} \right)\]	

The quantity in the parentheses can be simplified to

\[\left( {\frac{1}{{{L_A}}} - \frac{1}{{{L_B}}}} \right) = \frac{{{L_B} - {L_A}}}{{{L_A}{L_B}}} = \frac{L}{{{L_A}{L_B}}}\]	

So the equation becomes

\[\delta  = \frac{{PL_A^2}}{{E\pi r_A^2}}\frac{L}{{{L_A}{L_B}}} = \frac{{PL}}{{E\pi r_A^2}}\left( {\frac{{{L_A}}}{{{L_B}}}} \right)\]	

Finally, we know from similar triangles that $L_A/L_B = r_A/r_B$.

\[\delta  = \frac{{PL}}{{E\pi r_A^2}}\left( {\frac{{{r_A}}}{{{r_B}}}} \right) = \frac{{PL}}{{\pi E{r_A}{r_B}}}\]

\end{solution}

\section{Statically Indeterminate Systems}

In the case where the deformation of the member can be determine solely from equation of equilibrium and free-body diagram, the structure of that type is classified as statically determinate. It is also important to note that the force in this type of structure can be determined without the knowledge of properties of the materials.

However, most structures are more complex than this. The internal forces and reactions cannot be determined from the equation of equilibrium alone. For example, consider a bar that is attached on both sides to walls. A force P is applied in the middle of the beam towards the right wall. Now, it is impossible to determine the internal force and reaction forces since there is only one useful equation of equilibrium but two unknown forces (reaction forces at either end). This type of structure is classified as statically indeterminate. To analyze such structures we must supplement the equilibrium equations with additional equations pertaining to the displacement of the structure.

The equation that pertains to the displacement requirements of the structure is called an equation of compatibility.

To solve both the equation of equilibrium and equation of compatibility, we must establish the relationship between the force and displacement, this we can borrow from our knowledge of statically determinate system of axially loaded members that
	
We shall now look at a simple example to better understand the steps in analyzing statically indeterminate system.

\begin{example}
  A circular bar AB is fixed on both end between the two walls of the same distance apart as the unstretched length of the bar $L$. The bar has a constant cross-sectional area $A$. Force $P$ is exerted on the bar at point C. Find the reaction at both point A and B.
  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Axial-load/statically-indet}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
First, we know that there would be reactions at both points A and B. Using the equation of equilibrium, we know that the bar is in equilibrium, and therefore

\[\sum F  = 0 = P - {F_A} - {F_B}\]

We also know that the bar is restrained between two walls, preventing any length change so that the deformation of segment AC and CB must sum up to zero.

\[{\delta _{AC}} + {\delta _{CB}} = 0\]

Finally, we apply force-displacement relationship based on Hooke’s law. We know that the force in segment AC is $F_A$ in the compressive direction, and that the force in segment CB is $F_B$ in the tensile direction. We substitute the force-displacement relationship into the compatibility equation so that we have

\[ - \frac{{{F_A}{L_{AC}}}}{{AE}} + \frac{{{F_B}{L_{CB}}}}{{AE}} = 0\]	

Solving this equation, we have

\[{F_B} = \frac{{{L_{AC}}}}{{{L_{CB}}}}{F_A}\]	

So the magnitude of the reaction is inversely proportional to the distance away from the applied load. Substitute the solution into the equation of equilibrium, we have

\[\begin{gathered}
  {F_A} = \frac{{{L_{CB}}}}{L}P \hfill \\
  {F_B} = \frac{{{L_{AC}}}}{L}P \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]
\end{solution}

\section{Statically Indeterminate Systems with Thermal Effects}

As mentioned in section 1.3, external loads are not the only sources of stress and strains in a structure. Changes in temperature can produce expansion or contraction of the material, resulting in thermal strains and stresses.

In statically indeterminate structures, the total change in length when considering thermal effects is simply the sum of the change from external loads and the change from thermal effects. Similarly, in the case of statically indeterminate structures, thermal effects apply directly into equations of compatibility. After the effect has been properly accounted for, the structures can be analyzed as normal.

\begin{example}
  Using the previous example of the bar fixed at both ends between the walls. Once the force $P$ is applied, what is the change in temperature so that there is no stress in segment AC? Assume that the material of the bar has Young’s modulus $E$ and cross-sectional area $A$.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Axial-load/statically-indet}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}
\begin{solution}

  There are still support forces at A and B. The equilibrium equation in this case would remain the same

  \[\sum F  = 0 = P - {F_A} - {F_B}\]

  Also, as the bar is still fixed at both ends, it cannot change in length. Therefore the sum of the change in length of both segments must be zero.

  \[{\delta _{AC}} + {\delta _{CB}} = 0\]	

  Finally, we apply force-displacement relationship based on Hooke’s law. We know that the force in segment AC is $F_A$ in the compressive direction, and that the force in segment CB is $F_B$ in the tensile direction. However, there is also the change in length of each segment due to the temperature change, so we must substitute in the change in length of both segments with force-displacement and displacement-temperature change relationships
  
  \[\begin{gathered}
      - \frac{{{F_A}{L_{AC}}}}{{AE}} + \alpha \Delta T{L_{AC}} + \frac{{{F_B}{L_{CB}}}}{{AE}} + \alpha \Delta T{L_{CB}} = 0 \\ 
      - \frac{{{F_A}{L_{AC}}}}{{AE}} + \frac{{{F_B}{L_{CB}}}}{{AE}} + \alpha \Delta T({L_{CB}} + {L_{AC}}) = 0 \\ 
      - \frac{{{F_A}{L_{AC}}}}{{AE}} + \frac{{{F_B}{L_{CB}}}}{{AE}} + \alpha \Delta TL = 0 \\ 
    \end{gathered} \]	
  
  Solving this equation we have
  
  \[\begin{gathered}
      {F_A} = P\frac{{{L_{CB}}}}{L} + \frac{{\alpha \Delta T}}{{AE}} \hfill \\
      {F_B} = P\frac{{{L_{AC}}}}{L} - \frac{{\alpha \Delta T}}{{AE}} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered} \]
  
  To reduce the stress in segment AC to zero, its internal force must be zero, and therefore the reaction at A must be zero. Setting $F_A = 0$, we have
  
  \[\Delta T =  - \frac{{PAE}}{\alpha }\frac{{{L_{CB}}}}{L}\]
  
\end{solution}
\section{Inelastic Deformation}

In the previous sections, we have discussed the analysis of structures when the material stress never exceeds yield strength. However, in some engineering applications, especially in designing steel members, the design must take into account the behavior after the stress has reached yield strength. To meaningfully analyze the behavior into the plastic regime of deformation, we must first introduce the concept of elastic perfectly plastic materials.

\subsection{Elastic perfectly plastic materials}

In this type of material, the stress-strain behavior is linear throughout its elastic region. However, once the stress reaches yield strength, the material can no longer support additional stress. The strain, on the other hand, will keep increasing even after the stress reaches yield point, resulting in a flat stress-strain diagram after yield point.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
    \draw[<->](-5,0)--(5,0) node[right]{$\varepsilon$};
    \draw[<->](0,-5)--(0,-4) node[right]{$-S_y$} -- (0,4) node[left]{$S_y$} -- (0,5) node[right]{$\sigma$};
    \draw[thick, Blue](-5,-4) -- (-2,-4) -- (2,4) -- (5,4);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  %\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Axial-load/elastic-perfectly-plastic}
  \caption{Typical behavior of an elastic-perfectly plastic material.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Residual Stress}

When a material is loaded beyond its yield point, the material will go into plastic deformation for which even after the load is removed, the deformation will remain. When the material is not restrained by supports, the deformation will manifest itself in dimension changes. On the other hand, if the material is restrained, the plastic deformation cannot manifest itself in the form of dimension changes but in residual stress instead. In this case, the methods of solving statically indeterminate problems apply here as well.

We must, however, be mindful that now the material stress-strain response is more complicated—the material is now assumed to be elastic-perfectly plastic. Therefore, after the initial stress analysis through the use of equations of equilibrium and equations of compatibility, we must validate that the stress in any member remains at or below yield point.

To solve a residual stress problem, where there is a cycle of loading and unloading, we must employ the principle of superposition of positive load (loading) and negative load (unloading). The loading results in both elastic and plastic deformations while the unloading results only in an elastic stress. After superposition, the loads will cancel; however, the stress distribution will not cancel and therefore residual stress will remain.

\begin{example}

  A circular bar AB having radius of 1 in is fixed between two walls 5 ft apart. A load $P$ is applied to a point 2 ft from the left wall towards the left wall. The circular bar has a stress-strain response as shown. Find
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The minimum magnitude of $P$ so that both segments of the beam will start to yield.
  \item The permanent deformation of point C after the force $P$ is removed.
  \end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  
  First we find the Young’s modulus of the bar material
  
  \[E = \frac{{(20 \times {{10}^3})}}{{0.001}} = 2 \times {10^7} \text{ psi}\]	
  
  For both segments of the beam to yield, the stresses in both segments must reach yield point, which is at 20 ksi. However, when force $P$ is applied, the left segment will be in compression, while the right will be in tension. Therefore, we have
  
  \begin{align*}
    &{\sigma _{AC}} =  - 20 \times {10^3} \text{ psi} \\
    &{\sigma _{CB}} = 20 \times {10^3} \text{ psi}
  \end{align*}	

  Using equilibrium equation, we can solve for force $P$ from the support forces at A and B.
  
  \begin{align*}
    P = {F_A} + {F_B} &= 2(20 \times {10^3} \text{ psi})(\pi ){(1 \text{ in})^2} \\ 
                      &= 1.26 \times {10^3} \text{ lb}
  \end{align*}	
  
  Note that the support forces at A and B are equal because the stresses in both segments have the same magnitude.
  
  To find the permanent deformation, we first need to find the residual stress. By applying the principle of superposition, we can find the residual stress after unloading by summing the stresses from loading $P$ to the left and to the right. Since we have already found the stresses from loading P to the left, we will proceed to find the stresses from the ‘unloading’ force $P$ at point C to the right.
  
  \begin{align*}
    {({\sigma _{AC}})_{unload}} &= \frac{{{L_{CB}}}}{L}\frac{P}{A} = \frac{{(3)(1.26 \times {{20}^5} \text{ lb})}}{{(5)\pi {{(1 \text{ in})}^2}}} = 2.4 \times {10^4} \text{ psi} \text{ (tensile)} \\
  {({\sigma _{CB}})_{unload}} &= \frac{{{L_{AC}}}}{L}\frac{P}{A} = \frac{{(2)(1.26 \times {{20}^5} \text{ lb})}}{{(5)\pi {{(1 \text{ in})}^2}}} = 1.6 \times {10^4} \text{ psi} \text{ (compressive)}
  \end{align*}	
  
  Note that we do not need to be concern about the stress going beyond the yield point in the unloading case because this is a ‘fictitious’ load used to apply the principle of superposition.
  
  The residual stresses are simply the sum of the stresses from loading and unloading forces.
  
  \begin{align*}
    ({\sigma _{AC}})_r &=  - 20 \times {10^3} + 2.4 \times {10^4} \text{ psi}\;({\text{tensile}}) = 4 \times 10^3 \text{ psi}  \\
    ({\sigma _{CB}})_r &= 20 \times {10^3} - 1.6 \times {10^4}\;psi\;({\text{compressive}}) = 4 \times 10^3 \text{ psi}
  \end{align*}	
  
  This confirms that our calculation is correct since the residual stresses in both segments are identical.
  To calculate the permanent deformation, we must calculate using CB since this section is only beginning to yield, while AC has yielded and we can no longer specify the strain accompanying the deformation due to the material’s elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. The permanent strain associated with CB is that resulting from residual stress.
  
  \begin{align*}
    {({\varepsilon_{CB}})_r} &= \frac{{{{({\sigma _{CB}})}_r}}}{E} = \frac{{4 \times {{10}^3} \text{ psi}}}{{20 \times {{10}^6} \text{ psi}}} = 2 \times {10^{ - 4}} \hfill \\
    {({\delta _{CB}})_r} &= {({\varepsilon _{CB}})_r}{L_{CB}} = 2 \times {10^{ - 4}}(3) = 6 \times 10^{-4} \text{ ft} \hfill 
  \end{align*}	
  
  Since AC yielded under compression first, the material will keep deforming until BC begins to yield. Therefore, AC has become shorter due to plastic deformation, and point C moves to the left after unloading by 0.0006 ft.
  
\end{solution}

\section{Dynamic Loading and Material Response}

In previous sections, we have discussed the response of the structure where the applied load is constant, both in terms of magnitude and direction. We will now assume that the load can vary in magnitude and in direction. First, we will discuss the response of a structure when the applied load is due to an impact. This usually occurs when an object with initial velocity collides with the structure. Then we will discuss briefly about the case of periodic loads and material fatigue. A more detailed exploration of fatigue will be discussed further in \cref{section: fatigue failure}.

\subsection{Impact loading}

Impact loading is when the application and the removal of the load are sudden. Impact loads are produced when two objects collide or when a falling object strikes a structure. As an example of how structures respond to impact loads, we will now discuss the impact of an object falling on a prismatic bar, illustrated in \cref{fig: impact loading}. A collar of mass $m$, initially at rest, falls from a height $h$ onto a flange at the lower end of bar AB. When the collar strikes the flange, the bar begins to elongate, creating axial stress and strains within the bar. In a very short interval of time, the flange will move downward and reach its position maximum displacement. Afterwards, the bar shortens, then lengthens, then shortens again as the bar vibrates longitudinally and the end of the bar moves up and down. The vibrations are analogous to those that occur when a spring is stretched and then released, or when a person makes a bungee jump. The vibrations soon cease and the bar comes to rest with the mass $m$ supported on the flange. The response of the bar to the falling collar is very complicated. However, we can make an approximate analysis by suing the concept of strain energy and make several simplifying assumptions.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Axial-load/impact-load}
  \caption{Initial, impact, and maximum deformation conditions in simplified impact loading problem}
  \label{fig: impact loading}
  \end{figure}

  Consider the energy of the system just before the collar is released. The potential energy of the collar with respect to the elevation of the flange is $mgh$, when $g$ is the acceleration of gravity. This potential energy is converted into kinetic energy as the collar falls. At the instant the collar strikes the flange, its potential energy with respect to the elevation is zero and its kinetic energy is $mv^2/2$, where $v = (2gh)^{1/2}$ is its velocity. Following the impact, the kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy such as plastic deformation, heat, and sound. However, we will assume that the kinetic energy is transformed into other forms of energy such as plastic deformation, heat, and sound. However, we will assume that the kinetic energy is wholly transferred to the elastic strain energy in the flange, and that after the collision, the collar ‘sticks’ to the flange as it deforms.

Using these assumptions, we can now calculate the maximum deformation and the stresses produced by the impact load.

\begin{gather}
  mg(h+ \delta_{\max}) = \frac{EA \delta_{\max}^2}{2L} \nonumber \\
  \left( \frac{EA}{2L} \right) \delta_{\max}^2 - mg \delta_{\max} - mgh = 0 \nonumber
\end{gather}

Notice that $mg$ is simply the weight of mass $m$. So let $mg = W$

\begin{align}
  \delta_{\max} = \frac{WL}{EA} + \left[ \left( \frac{WL}{EA} \right)^2 + 2h \left( \frac{WL}{EA} \right) \right]^{1/2}
\end{align}

Notice that $W\mspace{-2mu}L/EA$ is simply the deformation of the bar due to static weight $W$. In other words, $\delta_{st} = W\mspace{-2mu}L/EA$.

\begin{equation}
  \delta_{\max} = \delta_{st} + \left[ \delta_{st}^2 + 2h\delta_{st} \right]^{1/2}
\end{equation}

When $h \gg \delta_{st}$

\begin{equation}
  \delta_{\max} = \sqrt{2h \delta_{st}} = \sqrt{ \frac{mv^2L}{EA} }
\end{equation}

We can similarly show the resultant impact stress, assuming that $\delta = \sigma L / E$

\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\max} &= \frac{\delta_{\max} E}{L} \nonumber \\
                &= \frac{W}{A} + \left[ \left( \frac{W}{A} \right)^2 + 2h \left( \frac{W}{A} \right) \right]^{1/2} \nonumber \\
                &= \sigma_{st} + \left[ \sigma_{st}^2 + 2h \sigma_{st} \right]^{1/2}
\end{align}

And if $h$ is large, then

\begin{equation}
  \sigma_{\max} = \sqrt{ 2h \sigma_{st} } = \sqrt{ \frac{mv^2 E}{AL} }
\end{equation}

Comparison between static and impact responses can be done using the \emph{impact factor}, defined as

\begin{equation}
  \text{impact factor} = \frac{\delta_{\max}}{\delta_{st}} = \frac{\sigma_{\max}}{\sigma_{st}}
\end{equation}

Impact factors can then be used to apply to determine proper design parameters for components under impact loading.

\section*{Summary}

When the deformation of a body is negligible, its longitudinal deformation can be considered using axially loaded member methodology. First, we consider statically determinate cases, where the use of equilibrium equation is sufficient to determine the deformation of the body. Second, we consider statically indeterminate cases, where, in addition to equilibrium equation, we also need compatibility equation to determine the deformation. From this, we assumed that materials are allowed to deform well into their plastic regimes. After which the removal of the force will lead to permanent deformation and, in certain cases, residual stresses. We then proceeded to relax the assumption that the external force is static, which leads us to impact loading and repeated loading.

\chapter{Analysis of Members under Torsion}

Torsion is a twist of a straight bar when loaded by moments that tend to produce rotation about the longitudinal axis of the bar. In this chapter, we begin by developing formulas for the deformations and stresses in circular bars under torsion. We then analyze the rotating shafts and determine the power they transmit. Finally, we cover several additional topics related to torsion such as statically indeterminate members, strain energy, thin-walled tubes, and power transmission.

\section{Simple torsion}

Simple torsion is the case where the cross-sectional area and the torque throughout the length of the material are constant. The understanding of simple torsion and its conditions can be applied to other more complex torsion in upcoming sections.

\subsection{Torsion of circular elastic bars}

When a circular bar is twisted by torques $T$ at the ends, every cross section of the bar is still identical and is subjected to the same internal torque $T$, we say that the bar is in pure torsion. From consideration of symmetry, it can be proved that cross sections of the bar do not change in shape as they rotate about the longitudinal axis. Furthermore, if the angle of rotation between one end of the bar and the other is small, neither the length of the bar nor its radius will change.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/3d-torsion}
  \caption{A circular bar under torsion. The figure shows the torque and deformation on the cross section.}
  \label{fig: 3d torsional deformation}
\end{figure}

Consider a circular bar under torsion in \cref{fig: 3d torsional deformation}. Under the action of torque $T$, if the left-hand end is fixed, the right-hand end will rotate through a small angle $\phi$, known as the angle of twist. The angle of twist changes along the axis of the bar, and at intermediate cross sections it will have a value $\phi(x)$, which we can prove varies linearly between the ends.

The shear strain in an element of length $dx$ is simply the change in the orientation of the originally straight longitudinal line. The change in the orientation can be defined by the angle of change along the length, which is

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: strain and angle of twist}
  \gamma _{\max } = \frac{{rd\phi }}{{dx}} = r\theta  = \frac{{r\phi }}{L}
\end{equation}

where $\theta$ is defined as the angle of twist per unit length, or rate of twist, and $r$ is the radius of the cross-section. Due to symmetry and our assumption that the cross section remains unchanged during the rotation, the radius of the cross section remains undistorted during this time as well, and therefore the shear strain within the interior of the bar radius away from the center is

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: strain and radius}
  \gamma  = \rho \theta  = \frac{\rho }{r}{\gamma _{\max }}
\end{equation}

Since the bar is in pure shear, we can apply Hooke’s law in shear to analyze the state of stress of the bar in torsion. We have

$$\tau  = G\gamma $$

in which $G$ is the shear modulus of elasticity. We can combine this equation with \cref{eqn: strain and angle of twist} and \cref{eqn: strain and radius} to get

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\tau _{\max }} = Gr\theta  \hfill \\
    \tau (\rho ) = G\rho \theta  = \dfrac{\rho }{r}{\tau _{\max }} \hfill 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

in which $\tau_{max}$ is the shear stress at the outer surface of the bar and $\tau$ is the shear stress at the interior point of radius $\rho$ from the center of the bar.
Now that we have figured out the stress and strain state in a circular bar under torsion, we will now go on to determine the relationship between the external load (in the case of torsion, the twisting moment or torque T and the shear stress.
First we consider a small element of area $dA$ located at a radial distance $\rho$ from the center of the bar. The shear force acting on the surface would be $\tau dA$ where $\tau$ is the shear stress at radius $\rho$. The moment from the shear force is simply the force times the distance from the center, $\tau \rho dA$. We can express this small moment as

\[dM = \tau \rho dA = \frac{{{\tau _{\max }}}}{r}{\rho ^2}dA\]

The resultant moment is simply the sum of these small moments across the cross-sectional area

\[T = \int_A {dT}  = \frac{{{\tau _{\max }}}}{r}\int_A {{\rho ^2}dA}  = \frac{{{\tau _{\max }}}}{r}{J}\]

in which $J$ is the polar moment of inertia of the circular cross section. By rearranging this equation, we obtain the maximum shear stress as a function of applied torque:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: torsion formula}
  {\tau _{\max }} = \frac{{Tr}}{{{J}}}
\end{equation}

This equation is called the torsion formula. Similar to shear strain, the shear stress at a distance $\rho$ from the center of the bar is

\begin{equation}
  \tau  = \frac{\rho }{r}{\tau _{\max }} = \frac{{T\rho }}{{{J}}}
\end{equation}

Finally, we can also relate the angle of twist of a linearly elastic bar to the applied torque T by combining Hooke’s law in shear and the torsion formula, for which we get

\[\begin{gathered}
    {\tau _{\max }} = Gr\theta \\
    {\tau _{\max }} = \frac{Tr}{J} \hfill \\
    \theta  = \frac{T}{{G{J}}} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered} \]

This shows that the rate of twist is directly proportional to the torque $T$ and inversely proportional to the product $GJ$. The total angle of twist for the bar in pure torsion is

\begin{equation}
  \phi  = \theta L = \frac{TL}{GJ} = \frac{T}{k_T}
\end{equation}

where $k_T = GJ/L$ is called the torsional stiffness of the bar.

\begin{example} Statically indeterminate torsional analysis in a cylindrical shaft
  
  A circular bar is supported at both ends by ball bearing hubs, allowing them to rotate freely. Three torques are applied along the length of the bar, their magnitudes, directions, and locations are shown in the figure. The bar has diameter of 3 cm, the material it is made of has G = 80 GPa. Find the maximum shear stress in each segment and angle of twist between point B and D.

  \begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/torsion-problem}
\end{figure}
  
\end{example}
  
\begin{solution}
First, we need to find the torque in each segment. We can use equation of equilibrium to calculate just that.

Using the method of section, within segment BC,

$$T =  - {T_1} =  - 275\text{ Nm}$$

Within segment CD,

\[T =  - {T_3} = 175\text{ Nm}\]

The maximum shear stress in each segment is at the outer diameter. We have

\[\begin{gathered}
  {\tau _{\max }} = \frac{{Tr}}{{{J}}} = \frac{{2T}}{{\pi {r^3}}} \hfill \\
  {({\tau _{\max }})_{BC}} = \frac{{2(275\text{ Nm})}}{{\pi {{(1.5 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}\text{ m})}^3}}} = 51.9\text{ MPa} \hfill \\
  {({\tau _{\max }})_{CD}} = \frac{{2(175\text{ Nm})}}{{\pi {{(1.5 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}\text{ m})}^3}}} = 33\text{ MPa} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Angle of twist between B and D is the sum of the angles of twist in BC and CD.

\[\begin{gathered}
  {\phi _{BD}} = {\phi _{BC}} + {\phi _{CD}} \hfill \\
  {J} = \frac{{\pi {r^4}}}{2} = \frac{{\pi {{(1.5 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}\;{\text{m}})}^4}}}{2} = 7.95 \times {10^{ - 8}}\;{{\text{m}}^{\text{4}}} \hfill \\
  {\phi _{BC}} = \frac{{{T_{BC}}{L_1}}}{{G{J}}} = \frac{{( - 275\;{\text{Nm}})(0.5\;{\text{m}})}}{{(80\;{\text{GPa}})(7.95 \times {{10}^{ - 8}}\;{{\text{m}}^{\text{4}}})}} =  - 0.0216\;{\text{rad}} \hfill \\
  {\phi _{CD}} = \frac{{{T_{CD}}{L_2}}}{{G{J}}} = \frac{{(175\;{\text{Nm}})(0.4\;{\text{m}})}}{{(80\;{\text{GPa}})(7.95 \times {{10}^{ - 8}}\;{{\text{m}}^{\text{4}}})}} = 0.0110\;{\text{rad}} \hfill \\
  {\phi _{BD}} =  - 0.0216 + 0.0110 =  - 0.0106\;{\text{rad}} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Therefore, the bar twisted in the same direction as $T_2$ by 0.0106 rad.
\end{solution}

\section{Nonuniform Torsion}

\subsection{Nonuniform Torsion}

In the case of nonuniform torsion, we have loosened the restrictions previously and implicitly imposed on the previous section which are that the bar must be of constant cross section and that the torque throughout the length of the bar must be constant. In this case, we will use the method of sections and apply the principles already explained in the previous section to analyze nonuniform torsion.

To illustrate the procedure, we will divide nonuniform torsion problems into 3 cases.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Bar consisting of constant cross section segments with constant torque throughout each segment. For example, as the figure shows, the bar is made up of three constant cross segments. and throughout each cross section there is a constant torque.
  
  To analyze this problem, we simply use the method of section to determine the torque throughout each cross section. Once the internal torques is determined, we can apply the equations to find the shear stress or the angle o twist in each segment. The total angle of twist of the bar is simply the sum of the angles of twist for all segments. So we have that

  \end{equation}
  
  where $i$ indicates the numbering index for various segments.
  
\item Bar with continuously varying cross sections and constant torque. When the torque is constant, the maximum shear stress in a solid bar always occurs at the cross section having the smallest diameter. To find the angle of twist, we can consider an element of length $dx$ at distance $x$ from one end of the bar. The differential angle of twist $\phi$ is

  in which $J(x)$ is the polar moment of inertia of cross section at distance x from the end. The angle of twist of the entire bar is the sum of the differential angles of twist:
  
  \begin{equation}
    \phi  = \int_0^L \frac{Tdx}{G{J(x)}}
  \end{equation}
  
  If the expression for the polar moment of inertia is not too complex, the integral can be evaluated analytically; in other cases, however, it must be evaluated numerically.
  
\item Bar with continuously varying cross sections and continuously varying torque. The bar can be subjected to a distributed torque that varies along the length of an also varying cross section bar. We can use the method of sections to find the torque along the length of the bar. We also need to find the polar moment of inertia along the length of the bar. Once we know both quantities, we can use the torsion formula to determine the shear stress. The angle of twist can also be found in the same manner as case 2 except now the torque is also varying. So the equation for the total angle of twist becomes

\section{Statically Indeterminate Members under Torsion}

Similar to axially loaded members, when torque loaded members are constrained against deformation, the torque and deformation in any cross section cannot simply be determined using equilibrium equations alone. Compatibility equations must also be derived and taken into account in order to solve for the deformation and load properly.

\section{Power Transmission}

One of the most common uses of shafts and tubes under torsion is power transmission. When used for this purpose they are subjected to torques that depends on the power generated by the machine and angular speed of the shaft. We can express the power transmitted through a shaft as

\begin{equation}
  P = T\omega
\end{equation}

where $\omega$  is the angular speed of the shaft. For machinery, the frequency of rotation is also often reported. This is a measure of the number of rotations per second. Since one rotation of the shaft covers $2\pi$ radian, then

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: power-torque}
  \begin{gathered}
    \omega  = 2\pi f \hfill \\
    P = 2\pi fT \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\begin{example}
  A 40-mm diameter transmission shaft is connected to a motor whose output power is constant at 10 hp.  If the shaft needs to transfer the torque at shaft speed between 100 to 2000 rpm, what is the minimum shear stress the material should be able to withstand?
  
    \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \path[fill=white] (-5,-2) rectangle (5,2);
      %\draw (-5,-2) grid (5,2);

      (-4.5,-1.5) -- (-4,-1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}
  
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
From \cref{eqn: torsion formula}, the maximum shear stress in the shaft occurs when there is maximum torque applied. Using \cref{eqn: power-torque}, we can calculate the maximum torque due to the power transmission. It is evident from the equation that the maximum torque is transferred when the angular speed of the shaft is the lowest. Therefore, the maximum torque applied on the shaft is

\begin{align*}
  P &= 2\pi fT \\ 
  (10 \text{ hp})(746 \text{ W/hp}) &= 2\pi T (100 \text{ rpm})(1/60 \text{ s/min}) \\ 
  T &= 712 \text{ N-m}
\end{align*}	

The maximum shear stress on the material is

\begin{align*}
  {\tau _{\max }} &= \frac{{Tr}}{{{I_p}}} = \frac{{2T}}{{\pi {r^3}}} \\[5pt]
                  &= \frac{2(712 \text{ N-m})}{\pi (20 \times 10^{ - 3})^3} \\[5pt]
                  &= 56.7 \text{ MPa}  
\end{align*}

\end{solution}

\section{Torsion of Thin-walled Tubular Members}

Thin-walled tubes of non-circular shape are often used to construct lightweight frameworks. In some applications, they may be subjected to a torsional loading. In this section, we will analyze the effect of applying a torque to a thin-walled tube having a closed cross section. For this analysis, we will assume that the walls have a variable thickness $t$. Since the walls are thin, we will be able to obtain an approximate solution for the shear stress by assuming that this stress is uniformly distributed across the thickness of the tube. However, we will need to first discuss some preliminary concepts on the action of shear stress over the cross section.

\paragraph{Shear flow.} Consider a small element of a tube along the cross section having a finite length s and differential width $dx$. If the thickness of the tube is nonuniform along the length of the wall, let the thickness on one side be $t_b$ and on the other side be $t_c$. The shear stress on the $b$ side is $\tau_b$ while the stress on the $c$ side is $\tau_c$. Using equation of equilibrium, since the element is in equilibrium, the shear force on one face must be the same in magnitude as the shear force on the opposite face. In other words,

\[{F_b} = {\tau _b}{t_b}dx = {\tau _c}{t_c}dx = {F_c}\]

Since $dx$ is chosen arbitrarily, it follows that the product of shear stress and thickness at any point on the cross section is the same. This product is known as shear flow and is denoted by the letter $f$.

\begin{equation}
  f = {\tau _b}{t_b} = {\tau _c}{t_c} = {\text{constant}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Shear stress.} The next step is to relate the shear flow and the torque acting on the tube. To do that, consider an element of length $ds$ and thickness $t$. The distance $s$ defining the location of the element is measured along the median line from an arbitrary point. The median line is the line that passes through the middle of the wall thickness along the circumference of the tube.
The total shear force acting on the element is $fds$, and the moment of this force about an arbitrary point $O$ within the tube is

\[dT = rfds\]

In which $r$ is the perpendicular distance from point $O$ to the line of action of the force. The total torque produced by the shear stress is obtained by integrating along the median line.

\[T = f\int_0^{{L_m}} {rds} \]

In which $L_m$ denotes the length of the median line. While the integral may seem difficult at first, a simple geometric interpretation helps us evaluate the integral quite easily. $rds$ is twice the area of a triangle formed by $r$ and $ds$. Thus, summing the triangles along the median line gives us the area enclosed by the median line. So the integrals can be written as

\[T = f\int_0^{{L_m}} {rds}  = 2f{A_m}\]

where $A_m$ is the area enclosed by the median line. So we have torsion formula for thin-walled tubes as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: thin-walled torsion}
  \begin{gathered}
    f = \frac{T}{{2{A_m}}} \hfill \\
    \tau  = \frac{T}{{2t{A_m}}} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Angle of twist.} The angle of twist can be proven by the energy method, discussed later in this material. If the material is linearly elastic, the angle of twist, $\phi$, can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
  \phi = \frac{TL}{4 A_m^2 G} \oint \frac{ds}{t}
\end{equation}

Note that the line integral has to be performed around the entire median circumference of the cross section.

\begin{example}
  A rectangular tube with thickness of 2 mm throughout is being twisted by a torque. If the tube material has a maximum allowable shear stress of 150 MPa, find the maximum torque that could be applied on the tube.

\end{example}
\begin{solution}
From \cref{eqn: thin-walled torsion}, we need to first evaluate the area that the median line circumscribes. Since we are given the internal dimensions and thickness, the area circumscribed by the median line is simply the internal dimensions plus half the thickness.

\[\begin{gathered}
    A_m = (0.2 + 0.001 \text{ m})(0.3 + 0.001 \text{ m}) \\ 
    = 0.0605 \text{ m}^2 
  \end{gathered} \]	

After that, finding the maximum allowable torque is simply a matter of substituting all known variables, for which we have

\[\begin{gathered}
  {T_{allow}} = 2t{A_m}{\tau _{allow}} \\ 
   = 2(0.002 \text{ m})(0.0605 \text{ m}^2)(150 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}) \\ 
   = 36.3 \text{ kN-m} \\ 
\end{gathered} \]
\end{solution}

\section*{Summary}

Torque applied in the direction of the longitudinal axis a body leads to torsion. The problems in torsion are either statically determinate, where the body is unrestrained and can freely deform, and statically indeterminate, where the body is restrained by supports or other materials. The most important application of torsion is power transmission in shaft, in which our knowledge of torsion can help determine and design shafts of appropriate dimensions to meet requirements. Finally, we also learned about approximations and derivations leading to the relationship between torque, deformation, and shear stress in thin-walled tube.

\chapter{Analysis of Beam Bending}

When external load is applied perpendicular to the axis of the length of the beam, it will create a shear force and/or bending moment inside the beam. The deformation from this type of load is called deflection. N this chapter, we will analyze the relationship between the external load, the shear force, the bending moment, and the deflection of the beam.

\section{Symmetric Beam Bending}

First we will consider the simplest case of bending where the cross section of the beam in consideration has at least one axis of symmetry, and that the applied load is in the same plane as the axis of symmetry. This will cause bending in the plane of symmetry, resulting in symmetric beam bending.

\subsection{Longitudinal strains in beams}

The longitudinal strain in a beam can be found by analyzing the curvature of the beam and the associated deformations. For this purpose, let us consider a portion ab of a beam in pure bending subjected to positive bending moment M. Under the action of the bending moments, the beam deflects in the $xy$ plane and its longitudinal axis is bent into a circular curve. Cross sections of the beam are assumed to remain plane and normal to the longitudinal axis.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/pure-bending}
  \caption{Deformation in pure beam bending.}
  \label{fig: pure bending}
\end{figure}

Because of the bending deformations, cross sections rotate with respect to each other about axes perpendicular to $xy$ plane. As shown in \cref{fig: pure bending}, longitudinal lines of the convex part of the beam are elongated, while those on the concave side are shortened. Therefore, the lower part of the beam is in tension while the upper part is in compression. Somewhere between the top and bottom surface there is a surface where its longitudinal lines do not change in length. This surface is called the \emph{neutral surface}. Its intersection with any cross-sectional plane is called the neutral axis of the cross section.

The planes containing cross sections intersect in a line through the center of curvature. The angle between the two planes is denoted $d\theta$ and the distance to the neutral surface is the radius of curvature $\rho$. The initial distance between the two planes is unchanged at the neutral surface and thus $\rho d \theta = dx$. However, all other lines not on the internal surface either lengthen or shorten, creating normal strains.

To evaluate the normal strains, consider a longitudinal line located at a distance y away from the neutral surface in an initially straight beam. Once the beam deflects, the neutral surface moves with the beam, but the x axis remains fixed and therefore the longitudinal line is still located at the same distance y away. The new length of this longitudinal line becomes

\[(\rho  - y)d\theta  = dx - \dfrac{y}{\rho }dx\]

Therefore, the corresponding normal strain of this longitudinal line is simply the change in length divided by the original length, which is

\begin{equation}
  {\varepsilon _x} = \frac{{dx - \dfrac{y}{\rho }dx - dx}}{{dx}} =  - \dfrac{y}{\rho } =  - \kappa y
\end{equation}

where $\kappa$ is the curvature.

Note the negative sign in the equation; when the point of interest is above the neutral surface, the part is in compression, and vice versa.

The next step in our analysis is to find the stresses from the strains, which derive from Hooke’s law for linearly elastic materials.

\subsection{Normal stresses in beams}

Since we have established the relationship between the distance of the point of interest from the neutral surface and the normal strain in bending beam, we can now apply Hooke’s law for linearly elastic material to derive the stress in the beam.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [fill=SkyBlue] (0,0) arc [radius=9, start angle=120, end angle=90] --

    \draw (3.6,1.4) node[left]{$-\sigma$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Bending stress in uniform bending.}
\end{figure}

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: stress-strain bending}
  {\sigma _x} = E{\varepsilon _x} =  - E\frac{y}{\rho } =  - E\kappa y
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the normal stresses, just like normal strains, vary linearly with the distance $y$ from the neutral surface. For example, when the bending moment $M$ is positive and the beam bends with positive curvature, the stresses are negative (compression) above the neutral surface and positive (tension) below it.

However, in order for \cref{eqn: stress-strain bending} to be useful, we must first determine the location of the neutral axis on the cross section so that we may find the distance of the point of interest from it.

The location of the neutral axis can be determined by employing a static equilibrium equation. We know that the resultant force on any cross section of the beam is zero. We may then apply \cref{eqn: stress-strain bending} using this fact, thus we have

\[\int_A {{\sigma _x}dA}  =  - \int_A {E\kappa ydA}  = 0\]

Since the curvature and the modulus of elasticity are constants at any cross section of the beam, we have

\begin{equation}
  \int_A {ydA}  = 0
\end{equation}

This equation states that the first moment of the area of the cross section, evaluated with respect to the neutral axis, is zero. In other words, the neutral axis must pass through the centroid of the cross section.

\subsection{Moment-curvature formula}

We also know that the resultant moment of the normal stresses acting over the cross section must be equal to the bending moment at that cross section. Let us first consider the element of force $\sigma xdA$ acting on the element of area $dA$ is in the positive direction when $\sigma_x$ is positive. If the element $dA$ is located above the neutral axis, a positive stress would produce an element of moment in $\sigma_xydA$ the negative direction since it tends to bend the beam downward. Therefore, we have

\[dM =  - {\sigma _x}ydA\]

The sum of all the elemental moments of the entire cross section is simply the bending moment:

\[M =  - \int_A {{\sigma _x}ydA} \]

By substituting $\sigma_x = -E\kappa y$, we have

\[M =  - \int_A {\kappa E{y^2}dA}  =  - \kappa E\int_A {{y^2}dA} \]

which we can define as

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}


\[\begin{gathered}
  M = \kappa EI \hfill \\
  I = \int_A {{y^2}dA}  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

where $I$ is called the moment of inertia. We can now rearrange equation 3.43 in terms of the bending moment as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: moment-curvature}
  \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{M}{{EI}}
\end{equation}

This equation is known as the moment-curvature equation, showing that the curvature of the bending beam is directly proportional to the bending moment and inversely proportional to the quantity $EI$, which is called the \emph{flexural rigidity} of the beam.

\subsection{Elastic Flexure Formula}

Now that we have located the neutral axis and derived the moment-curvature relationship, we can determine the stress inside the beam from the bending moment. Substituting \cref{eqn: moment-curvature} into \cref{eqn: stress-strain bending}, we have

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: flexure formula}
  {\sigma _x} =  - \frac{{My}}{I}
\end{equation}

This equation is called the flexure formula, shows that the stresses are directly proportional to the bending moment $M$ and inversely proportional to the moment of inertial $I$. The stresses also vary linearly with the distance $y$ from the neutral axis.

\subsection{Maximum stress at a cross section}

From \cref{eqn: flexure formula}, we know that the maximum tensile stress and compressive stress on a given cross section occurs at points located the furthest away from the neutral axis. Assume the distance from the neutral axis to the extreme elements above and below to be $c_1$ and $c_2$ respectively, then the corresponding maximum normal stresses from the flexure formula are

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: section modulus}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _1} =  - \frac{{M{c_1}}}{I} =  - \frac{M}{{{S_1}}} \hfill \\
    {\sigma _2} =  - \frac{{M{c_2}}}{I} =  - \frac{M}{{{S_2}}} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

in which

\[\begin{gathered}
  {S_1} = \frac{I}{{{c_1}}} \hfill \\
  {S_2} = \frac{I}{{{c_2}}} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

The quantities $S_1$ and $S_2$ are known as the section moduli of the cross section.

\begin{example}
  A rectangular cross-sectioned beam is put under 3 point loading scheme as shown. Its cross-sectional width is 3 cm and height is 5 cm. Determine the maximum stress in the beam.

    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
  First, we must understand that the location along the beam where maximum stress occurs is the location of maximum bending moment. According to Error: Reference source not found, we know that the maximum bending moment occurs in the middle of the beam length. Using the method of sections and equilibrium equation, we have

  \begin{align*}
    M_{\max} &= 250 \text{ N} \times 0.5 \text{ m} \\
             &= 125 \text{ N-m}
  \end{align*}
  
  We can then use this bending moment to calculate the maximum stress. Maximum stresses occurs on the surface of the beam furthest away from the neutral axis, which in the case of a rectangular cross-sectioned beam, there are two—namely compressive on one surface and tensile on the other. The maximum distance away from the neutral axis is simply half of the beam cross-sectional height. So we have
  
  \begin{align*}
    \sigma_{\max} &= \pm \frac{My}{I} \\
                  &= \pm \frac{(125 \text{ N-m})(2.5 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m})}{ \dfrac{1}{12}(3 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m})(5 \times 10^{-2} m)^3} \\
                  &= \pm 10 \text{ MPa}
  \end{align*}
  
Since the bending moment is positive, the top surface will be in compression, while the bottom part will be in tension.
\end{solution}

\section{Beams of Composite Cross Sections}

Beams constructed of two or more different materials are referred to as composite beams. Many composite beams are designed so that the appropriate material can take an appropriate load type. For example, reinforced concrete beams are designed with steel wires since concrete is excellent at resisting compressive load but poor at resisting tensile load, while steel wires are good at resisting tensile load, but inadequate for resisting compressive load. Other composite beams are designed to reduce weight or cost while still perform relatively the same.

\subsection{Strains and stresses}

The strains in composite beams are determined from the same geometry as we used for finding strains in beams of one material. We assume that the cross sections remain plane during bending and therefore, the longitudinal strains in a composite beam still vary linearly from top to bottom of the beam, so that

\begin{equation}
  {\varepsilon _x} =  - \frac{y}{\rho } =  - \kappa y
\end{equation}

Since we have this linear strain distribution, we can quickly calculate the normal bending stress in the beam. Using Hooke’s law, we can derive the stress depending on the distance away from the neutral axis and the material the point of interest is located in:

\begin{align}
  {\sigma _{x1}} &=  - E\kappa {y_1}  \nonumber \\
  {\sigma _{x2}} &=  - E\kappa {y_2} 
\end{align}

in which $\sigma_{x1}$ is the stress in material 1 and $\sigma_{x2}$ is the stress in material 2.

\subsection{Neutral axis}

Just like in the case of beam with single material, there also exist a neutral plane and neutral aes on which there are no normal strains along the length of the beam. We can find the location of the neutral axis by employing the fact that the resultant axial force acting on any cross section of the beam is zero.

  \caption{Dimensions for determining the neutral axis in a composite beam.}
\end{figure}

\[ \int_1 {{\sigma _{x1}}dA}  + \int_1 {{\sigma _{x2}}dA}  = 0 \]

where the first integral is evaluated over the cross section of material 1 and the second integral is evaluated over the cross section of material 2. Substituting the value for stresses from equation 461 in this equation, we have

\[ - \int_1 {{E_1}\kappa ydA}  - \int_2 {{E_2}\kappa ydA}  = 0\]

Again, since the curvature is a constant at any given cross section, it can be cancelled from the equation, giving

\begin{equation}
  - {E_1}\int_1 {ydA}  - {E_2}\int_2 {ydA}  = 0
\end{equation}

The integrals in this equation represents the first moments of the two parts of the cross-sectional area with respect to the neutral axis. For any pair of uniform materials, equation 464 can be simplified to

\begin{equation}
  {E_1}{A_1}(y - { y_{c1}}) + {E_2}{A_2}(y - {y_{c2}}) = 0
\end{equation}

where $y_{c1}$ and $y_{c2}$ are distances from the neutral axis to the centroids of materials 1 and 2, respectively.

\subsection{Moment-curvature relationship}

The moment-curvature relationship for a composite beam may be determined from the condition that the moment resultant of the bending stresses is equal to the bending moment $M$ acting at the cross section. Using the same procedure as for a beam with single material, we employ equations 452 and 453 for two materials:

\[M =  - \int_A {{\sigma _x}ydA}  =  -  - \int_1 {{\sigma _{x1}}ydA}  - \int_2 {{\sigma _{x2}}ydA} \]

Substituting the normal stress in each material gives

\[M = \kappa {E_1}\int_1 {{y^2}dA}  - \kappa {E_2}\int_2 {{y^2}dA} \]

Rewriting the equation in simpler form gives

\begin{equation}
  M = \kappa ({E_1}I - {E_2}{I_2})
\end{equation}

where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the moments of inertia about the neutral axis of the cross-sectional areas of both materials. Therefore, the curvature of the beam can be written as

\begin{equation}
  \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{M}{{{E_1}{I_1} + {E_2}{I_2}}}
\end{equation}

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Bending stress distribution in composite beam.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Normal stresses}

The normal stresses in the beam can be obtained from the bending moment by substituting the expression for curvature into equation 461, we have

\begin{align}
  {\sigma _{x1}} = \frac{{My{E_1}}}{{{E_1}{I_1} + {E_2}{I_2}}} \nonumber \\
  {\sigma _{x2}} = \frac{{My{E_2}}}{{{E_1}{I_1} + {E_2}{I_2}}} 
\end{align}

These equations are also known as the flexure formulas for a composite beam.

\begin{example}
A composite beam made of two types of woods is subjected to bending under pure bending moment. The cross-sectional area of the beam is made up as shown below. The top layer wood has $E$ = 200 MPa, while the bottom layer has $E$ = 400 MPa. Determine the maximum compressive and tensile stresses in the beam.

\end{example}
\begin{solution}
We know that the top part of the beam will be in tension while the bottom will be in compression. However, to determine the stresses, we must first determine the location of the neutral axis. We can do so by using equation 464. Assume that the neutral axis is h m away from the bottom, we have

\[\begin{gathered}
  0 = 200 \times {10^6}(3 \times 5)(3.5 - h) + 400 \times {10^6}(2 \times 5)(1 - h) \hfill \\
  0 = 21 - 6h + 8 - 8h \hfill \\
  h = 2.07 \text{ cm} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]	

Calculating the area moment of inertia of each cross section, we have

\[\begin{gathered}
  {I_1} = \frac{1}{{12}}(5 \times {10^{ - 2}}){(3 \times {10^{ - 2}})^3} = 1.125 \times {10^{ - 7}} \text{ m}^4 \hfill \\
  {I_2} = \frac{1}{{12}}(5 \times {10^{ - 2}}){(2 \times {10^{ - 2}})^3} = 3.33 \times {10^{ - 8}} \text{ m}^4 \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]	

The maximum tensile stress, occurring on the top surface of the beam, is

\begin{align*}
  {\sigma _{\max \text{ tensile}}} &= \frac{{My{E_1}}}{{{E_1}{I_1} + {E_2}{I_2}}} \\ 
                             &= \frac{{ - 200[(2.07 - 5){\kern 1pt}  \times {{10}^{ - 2}}](200 \times {{10}^6})}}{{200 \times {{10}^6}(1.125 \times {{10}^{ - 7}}) + 400 \times {{10}^6}(3.33 \times {{10}^{ - 8}})}} \\ 
                             &= 32.8 \text{ MPa} 
\end{align*}

Similarly for the maximum compressive stress at the bottom surface is

\begin{align*}
  {\sigma _{\max \text{ compressive}}} &= \frac{{My{E_2}}}{{{E_1}{I_1} + {E_2}{I_2}}} \\ 
                                 &= \frac{{ - 200(2.07 \times {{10}^{ - 2}})(400 \times {{10}^6})}}{{200 \times {{10}^6}(1.125 \times {{10}^{ - 7}}) + 400 \times {{10}^6}(3.33 \times {{10}^{ - 8}})}} \\ 
                                 &= 46.2 \text{ MPa} 
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
	
\section{Doubly Symmetric Beams with Inclined Loads}

In previous sections, we discussed stresses and strains in beam bending under a load that is in the same plane of symmetry. However, many engineering structures require that the designed beam be subjected to inclined loads, or loads that are not in the plane of symmetry of the beam. In this case, we will limit our discussion to beams that are doubly symmetric; both the $xy$ and $xz$ planes are planes of symmetry. Also, the inclined loads must act through the centroid of the cross section to avoid twisting the beam.
In this case, we can determine the bending stress in the beam by applying the principle of superposition. By breaking the loads into their components in the plane of symmetry, we can simply add the stress resultants from the loads and obtain the total bending stress.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Bending stresses}

Let us assume that a doubly symmetric beam is loaded and that at a cross section, there is an inclined bending moment $M$ acting on it. The normal stresses from bending with the bending moment M can be obtained by breaking M into its $y$ and $z$ components. According to convention and $xyz$ coordinates, positive My creates a tensile stress in positive $z$ direction and vice versa, while positive $M_z$ creates a compressive stress in positive $y$ direction and vice versa. With this, we can use superposition to give the expression for normal stresses at any point:

\begin{equation}
  {\sigma _x} = \frac{{{M_y}z}}{{{yI_y}}} - \frac{{{M_z}y}}{{{I_z}}}
\end{equation}

in which $I_y$ and $I_z$ are the moments of inertia of the cross-sectional area with respect to the $y$ and $z$ axes, respectively.

\subsection{Neutral axis}

The equation of the neutral axis can be determined by knowing that along the neutral axis, the normal stress from bending is zero. So we have

\begin{equation}
  {\sigma _x} = 0 = \frac{{{M_y}}}{{{I_y}}}z - \frac{{{M_z}}}{{{I_z}}}y
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the neutral axis is a straight line passing through the centroid. The angle $\beta$ between the neutral axis and the $z$ axis is determined by

\begin{equation}
  \tan \beta  = \frac{y}{z} = \frac{{M_y}{I_z}}{{M_z}{I_y}}
\end{equation}

\section{Shear stresses in beams}

When the beam is in pure bending, there are only bending moments and normal stresses in the cross sections. However, most beams are subjected to loads that produce both bending moments and shear forces, resulting in nonuniform bending. In this case, both normal and shear stresses are developed in the beam.

To derive the formula for the shear stresses in a rectangular beam, we instead evaluate the vertical horizontal shear stresses acting between layers of the beam due to convenience, since both have the same magnitudes.

Let us consider a beam in nonuniform bending. Take an element with two adjacent cross sections $mn$ and $m_1n_1$ with distance $dx$ apart. On the left hand face, the bending moment $M$ and shear force $V$ is applied. Since the beam is in nonuniform bending, the bending moment and shear force may change along the length of the beam, and the corresponding quantities on the right hand face are $M + dM$ and $V + dV$.

On cross section $mn$ and $m_1n_1$, the normal stresses are

\[\begin{gathered}
  {\sigma _1} =  - \frac{{My}}{I} \hfill \\
  {\sigma _2} =  - \frac{{(M + dM)y}}{I} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Next, we separate a small subelement $mm_1pp_1$ by passing a horizontal plane through our initial element. Since the bending moments vary along the axis of the beam, the normal forces acting on the left hand and right hand sides are no longer of the same magnitude. The forces on the left $F_1$ and right side $F_2$ respectively, are

\[\begin{gathered}
    {F_1} = \int {\frac{{My}}{I}dA} \hfill \\
    {F_2} = \int {\frac{{(M + dM)y}}{I}dA} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered} \]

The rest of the force must be balanced by the shear force $F_3$, which gives us

\begin{align*}
  {F_3} = {F_2} - {F_1} &= \int {\frac{{(M + dM)y}}{I}dA}  - \int {\frac{{My}}{I}dA}  \\ 
                        &= \int {\dfrac{{(dM)y}}{I}dA} 
 \end{align*}

 Rearranging this equation, we have

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: shear stress eval}
  {F_3} = {F_2} - {F_1} = \frac{{dM}}{I}\int y dA
\end{equation}

Assuming the shear stress is evenly distributed across the width b of the beam, making the area the shear force is acting upon is $bdx$, gives us

\[{F_3} = \tau bdx\]

Substitute this into \cref{eqn: shear stress eval} and solve for shear stress gives

\[\tau  = \frac{{dM}}{{dx}}\left( {\frac{1}{{Ib}}} \right) \int ydA \]

We know that the quantity $dM/dx$ is equal to the shear force $V$. The integral is evaluated over the part of the cross section that we have chosen earlier. It represent the first moment of the partial cross section with respect to the neutral axis. If we denote the first moment by $Q$, we have

\begin{equation}
  \tau  = \frac{VQ}{Ib}
\end{equation}

This equation, known as the \emph{shear formula}, can be used to determine shear stress at any point in the cross section of a rectangular beam. Note that for a specific cross section, the shear force $V$, the moment of inertia $I$, and the cross-sectional width $b$ are constant; only the first moment $Q$ changes with the distance $y$ from the neutral axis.

\begin{example}
  A beam made of two 2 x 5 cm layers of identical material is held together by high-strength glue. The material has $E$ = 2 GPa. If, under a three-point bending test, the maximum load $P$ the beam can withstand is 1500 N before delamination, determine the maximum shearing strength of the glue. Assume that the glue layer is very small.

  \end{figure}
  
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  First, we need to find the location for maximum shear stress in the glue layer. The shear stress is directly proportional to the shear force in the cross section. In three-point bending where the load is applied in the middle of the length, the shear force magnitude is constant throughout = $P/2$ = 750 N, positive on the left half and negative on the right half. The shear stress can be derived from the equation

  \begin{align*}
    \tau  &= \frac{{VQ}}{{Ib}} \\ 
          &= \frac{{(750\;N)(5 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}) (2 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}) (1 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}) \text{ m}^3}}{{\frac{1}{{12}}(5{\kern 1pt}  \times {{10}^{ - 2}}\,m){{(4 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}\,m)}^3}(5 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}\,m)}} \\ 
          &= 1.125 \text{ MPa}
  \end{align*}
\end{solution}
	
\section{Shear Flow}

Occasionally in engineering practice, members are built up from several composite parts in order to achieve a greater resistance to loads. If the loads cause the members to bend, fasteners such as nails, bolts, or glue may be needed to keep the component parts from sliding relative to one another. In order to design these fasteners, it is necessary to know the shear force that must be resisted along the member’s length. This loading, when measured as a force per unit length, is referred to as the \emph{shear flow}, $q$.

\subsection{Shear flow in Built-Up Members}

Figure 12: Area of consideration for built-up members depends on joints of interest.
The magnitude of the shear flow along any longitudinal section of a beam can be obtained using a development similar to that for finding the shear stress in the beam. As in the consideration for shear stress, there will be three horizontal forces acting on the part. Two of these forces, $F$ and $F + dF$, are developed by normal stresses caused by the moments $M$ and $M + dM$, respectively. The third force, which for equilibrium equals $dF$, acts at the part and is said to be supported by the fastener.  Realizing that $dF$ is the result of $dM$, then, as in the case of the shear formula equation 488, we have

\begin{equation*}
  dF = \frac{{dM}}{I}\int_A {ydA}
\end{equation*}

The integral represents $Q$, the moment of area of $A$ about the neutral axis for the cross section. Since the segment has a length $dx$, the shear flow, or force per unit length along the beam, is $q = dF/dx$. Hence dividing both sides by dx and noting that $V = dM/dx$, we can write

\[q = \frac{{VQ}}{I}\]

where $V$ is the internal shear force and $I$ is the moment of inertia of the entire cross-sectional area about the neutral axis.

\subsection{Shear flow in thin-walled members}

In the previous section we developed the shear-flow equation and showed how it can be used to determine the shear flow acting along any longitudinal plane of a member. In this section we will show how to apply this equation to find the shear-flow distribution throughout a member’s cross-sectional area. Here we will assume that the member has thin walls. As will be shown, this analysis has important applications in structural and mechanical design.

Figure 13: Shear flow magnitude and direction along the cross section of a channel section.

Before we determine the shear-flow distribution on a cross section, we will first show how the shear flow is related to the shear stress. To do this, consider the segment dx of a wide-flange beam. The force dF is developed along the shaded longitudinal section in order to balance the normal forces $F$ and $F + dF$ created by the moments $M$ and $M + dM$, respectively. Since the segment has a length dx, then the shear flow or force per length along the section is $q = dF/dx$. Because the flange wall is thin, the shear stresswill not vary much over the thickness $t$ of the section; so that we will assume that it is constant. Hence, $dF = \tau dA = \tau t dA = qdx$, or 

\[q = \tau t\]

Like the shear stress, the shear flow acts on both longitudinal and transverse planes. Although it exists, we will neglect the vertical transverse component of the shear flow, since it can be shown that it is approximately zero throughout the thickness of the element. This is because the walls are assumed to be thin and the top and bottom surfaces of the elements are free of stress. To summarize, then, only the shear-flow component that acts parallel to the walls of the member will be considered.

By a similar analysis, isolation of the left-hand segment on the top of the flange will establish the correct direction of the shear flow on the corner element of the segment. This illustrates how the direction of the shear flow can be established at any point of a beam’s cross section. Using the shear-flow formula, $q = VQ/I$, we will now show how to determine the distribution of the shear flow throughout the cross section. It is to be expected that this formula will give reasonable results for the shear flow since the accuracy of this equation improves for members having thin rectangular cross sections. For any application, however, the shear force must act along an axis of symmetry or principal centroidal axis of inertia for the cross section.

Let us find the distribution of shear flow along the top right flange of the wide-flange beam. To do this, consider the shear flow $q$, acting on an element located an arbitrary distance $x$ from the centerline of the cross section. It is determined that $Q$ for this cross section is $[d/2](b/2 - x)t$. Thus,

\[q = \frac{{VQ}}{I} = \frac{{V\left( {\dfrac{d}{2}} \right)\left( {\dfrac{b}{2} - x} \right)t}}{I} = \frac{{Vtd}}{{2I}}\left( {\frac{b}{2} - x} \right)\]

This distribution is linear, varying from $q = 0$ at $x = b/2$ to $(q_{max})f = Vtdb/4I$ at $x = 0$. Due to symmetry, a similar analysis yields the same distribution of shear flow for the other flanges.

The total force developed in the left and right portions of a flange can be determined by integration. Since the force on the element is $dF = qdx$, then

\[{F_f} = \int {qdx}  = \int_0^{b/2} {\frac{{Vtd}}{{2I}}\left( {\frac{b}{2} - x} \right)dx}  = \frac{{Vtd{b^2}}}{{16I}}\]

Also, we can determine this result by finding the area under the triangle since $q$ is a distribution of force per length. Hence,

\[{F_f} = \frac{1}{2}{({q_{\max }})_f}\left( {\frac{b}{2}} \right) = \frac{{Vtd{b^2}}}{{16I}}\]

The directions of these forces from all flanges show that the horizontal force equilibrium is maintained.

A similar analysis can be performed for the web. Here, we have

\begin{align*}
  Q = \sum {\bar y'A'}  &= \left( {\frac{d}{2}} \right)(bt) + \left[ {y + \left( {\frac{1}{2}} \right)\left( {\frac{d}{2} - y} \right)} \right]t\left( {\frac{d}{2} - y} \right) \\ 
                        &= \left( {\frac{{btd}}{2}} \right) + \left( {\frac{t}{2}} \right)\left( {\frac{{{d^2}}}{4} - {y^2}} \right)
\end{align*}	

So we can calculate the shear flow for the web as

\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{{VQ}}{I} = \frac{{Vt}}{I}\left[ {\frac{{db}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\left( {\frac{{{d^2}}}{4} - {y^2}} \right)} \right]
\end{equation}

For the web, the shear flow varies in a parabolic manner with the maximum value in the middle of the web ($y = 0$) where

\[{({q_{\max }})_w} = \left( {\frac{{Vtd}}{I}} \right)\left( {\frac{b}{2} + \frac{d}{8}} \right)\]	

In order to determine the force in the web, Fw, we must integrate q, giving

\begin{align}
  {F_w} = \int {qdy}  &= \int_{ - d/2}^{d/2} {\frac{{Vt}}{I}\left[ {\frac{{db}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\left( {\frac{{{d^2}}}{4} - {y^2}} \right)} \right]dy} \nonumber \\ 
   &= \frac{{Vt}}{I}\left[ {\frac{{dby}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\left( {\frac{{y{d^2}}}{4} - \frac{{{y^3}}}{3}} \right)} \right]_{ - d/2}^{d/2} \nonumber \\ 
   &= \frac{{Vt{d^2}}}{{4I}}\left( {2b + \frac{d}{3}} \right)
\end{align}

\section{Shear Center}

In previous section, it was assumed that the internal shear V was applied along a principal centroidal axis of inertia that also represents an axis of symmetry for the cross section. In this section, we will consider the effect of applying the shear along a principal centroidal axis that is \emph{not} an axis of symmetry. For the scope of this course, only thin-walled members will be analyzed using simply the centerline of the walls of the members.

Figure 14: Shear centers of a channel section when loaded along different directions

A typical example is a channel section which is fixed on one side and is subjected to a force $P$ along a vertical, unsymmetrical axis that passes through the centroid of the cross-sectional area. The channel will not only bend downward, but will also twist.

In order to understand why the member twists, it is necessary to study the shear-flow distribution along the channel’s flanges and web. When this distribution is integrated over the flange and web areas, it will give resultant forces of $F_f$ in each flange and a force of $V = P$ in the web. If the moments of these forces are summed about point $A$ in the middle of the web, it can be seen that the torque created by the flange forces is responsible for the twist. The actual twist is opposite to the direction of the moment from shear flow since it is the \emph{internal} force $F_f$ that causes the twisting. In order to prevent this twisting, it is therefore necessary to apply the load $P$ at a point $O$ located a distance $e$ from the web of the channel. We can determine the distance $e$ by setting the sum of the twisting moment from shear flow equal to the moment created from applying the load $P$ at a distance $e$ from the web. Taking point $A$ as center of rotation, we have

\[\begin{gathered}
  Pe = {F_f}d \hfill \\
  e = \frac{{{F_f}d}}{P} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

$F_f$ can be evaluated in terms of $P$ and the dimensions of the flanges and web, allowing $P$ to be canceled out. This leaves us with the expression for $e$ simply as a function of the cross-sectional geometry and independent of P or its location along the length of the beam. The point $O$ located at a distance $e$ away is called the \emph{shear center} or \emph{flexural center}. When $P$ is applied at the shear center, the beam will bend without twisting.

It should also be noted that the shear center will always lie on an axis of symmetry of a member’s cross-sectional area. Obviously, if a member has two axes of symmetry, then the shear center will coincide with the intersection of these axes (the centroid).

\begin{example}
Find the shear center of a channel section. Given a channel section has thickness of $t$ throughout, the height of $d$, and the width of $b$.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
If there is force $V$ applied on the section, the resultant shear flow in the horizontal sections at distance $x$ from the right end is

\[\begin{gathered}
  q = \frac{{VQ}}{I} = \frac{{V\left( {\frac{d}{2}} \right)(b - x)t}}{I} \\ 
   = \frac{{Vtd}}{{2I}}(b - x) \\ 
\end{gathered} \]	

We can evaluate this to the shear force in the top and horizontal flange (same magnitude, only opposite direction) as

\[\begin{gathered}
  {F_h} = \int_0^b {qdx}  \\ 
   = \frac{{Vtd{b^2}}}{{4I}} \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Note that it is unnecessary to find the shear force in the vertical section since when we take torque about, say, a point $O$ in the middle of the vertical section, the moment resultant of the vertical shear force is zero. Therefore, the torque about point $O$ is simply

\[T = {F_h}d = \frac{{Vt{d^2}{b^2}}}{{4I}}\]

The shear center of the section, the location at which the application of force $V$ results in no torque about point O, can be defined as the distance e from O as

\[\begin{gathered}
  Ve = T = \frac{{Vt{d^2}{b^2}}}{{4I}} \\ 
  e = \frac{{t{d^2}{b^2}}}{{4I}} \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

In this case, the moment of inertia of the channel section is

\[I = \frac{1}{{12}}t{d^3} + 2\left( {\frac{1}{{12}}b{t^3} + {{\left( {\frac{d}{2}} \right)}^2}bt} \right)\]	

We can ignore term(s) with $t^3$ since it becomes very small, the distance e becomes

\[e = \frac{{t{d^2}{b^2}}}{{\dfrac{1}{3}t{d^3} + 2{d^2}bt}} = \frac{{{b^2}}}{{\dfrac{d}{3} + 2b}} = \frac{b}{{2 + \left( {\dfrac{d}{{3b}}} \right)}}\]	
Note that $e$ is independent of $t$ and ranges from 0 to $b/2$ depending on the ratio $d/3b$.
\end{solution}

\section{Bending in Curved Beams}
                
The flexure formula applies to a prismatic member that is straight, since it was shown that for a straight member the normal strain varies linearly from the neutral axis. If the member is curved, however, this assumption becomes inaccurate, and so we must develop another equation that describes the stress distribution. In this section, we will consider the analysis of a curved beam--a beam that has a curved axis and is subjected to bending.

First, we must assume that the cross-sectional area is constant and that the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the applied moment. Like the case of a straight beam, we will assume that the cross sections of the member remain plane after the moment is applied, and that any distortion of the cross section within its own plane will be neglected.

To perform the analysis, three radii extending from the center of curvature of the member must be identified: $r_c$ references the radius to the centroid for the cross-sectional area, $R$ references the yet unspecified radius to the neutral axis, and $r$ indicates a radius to an arbitrary point or an infinitesimal area $dA$ on the cross section. Notice that the neutral axis lies within the cross section, since a bending moment always creates tension on one side of the member and compression on the other, and by definition, the neutral axis is a line of zero stress and strain.

\subsection{Strains and stresses}

If we isolate a differential segment of the beam, the stress tends to deform the material such that each cross section will rotate through an angle $\delta \theta / 2$. The normal strain $\varepsilon$ in the arbitrary strip of material located at $r$ will now be determined. This strip has an original length $r\delta\theta$. Due to the rotation $\delta \theta /2$, however, the strip’s total change in length is $\delta \theta (R-r)$. Consequently,

\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon  = \frac{{\delta \theta (R - r)}}{{rd\theta }}
\end{equation}

Defining $k = \delta \theta / d \theta$, which is constant for any particular element, we have

\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon  = k\left( {\frac{{R - r}}{r}} \right)
\end{equation}

Unlike the case of straight beams, here it can be seen that the normal strain is nonlinear function of $r$. This is true even though the cross section of the beam remains plane after the deformation. If the material only deforms elastically, Hooke’s law still applies, and we can derive the normal stress as a function of position as

\begin{equation}
  \sigma  = Ek\left( {\frac{{R - r}}{r}} \right)
\end{equation}

Now that the stress has been established, we can now determine the location of the neutral axis and relate the stress distribution to the resultant internal moment $M$.

\subsection{Neutral axis}

The location $R$ of the neutral axis can be determined by setting the resultant internal force caused by the stress distribution over the cross section to be zero.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \int_A {\sigma dA}  = 0 \hfill \\
    \int_A {Ek\left( {\frac{{R - r}}{r}} \right)dA}  = 0 \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

Since $Ek$ and $R$ are constants, we have

\[R\int_A {\frac{{dA}}{r}}  - \int_A {dA}  = 0\]

Solving for $R$ yields

\begin{equation}
  R = \dfrac{A}{{\int_A {\dfrac{{dA}}{r}} }}
\end{equation}

where $R$ is the location of the neutral axis, measured as a distance from the center of curvature, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the member, and $r$ is the radius of position of the small area $dA$ from the center of curvature.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption{Properties of various cross-sectional shapes for curved beams.}
  \begin{tabular}{ L{3cm} C{5cm} }
    \toprule
    Cross section & Radius of neutral surface \\
    \midrule
    Rectangle & \[R = \frac{A}{{\ln \dfrac{{{r_o}}}{{{r_i}}}}}\] \\
    Circle & \[R = \frac{A}{{2\pi ({r_c} + \sqrt {r_c^2 - {c^2}} )}}\] \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Moment-stress distribution relationship}

In order to relate the stress distribution to the resultant bending moment, we require the resultant internal moment to be equal to the moment of the stress distribution computed about the neutral axis. The stress $\sigma$, acting on the area element $dA$ and located a distance $y$ from the neutral axis, creates a force $dF = \sigma dA$ on the element and a moment $dM = y(\sigma dA)$ about the neutral axis. This moment is positive, since by the right hand rule, it is in the same direction as $M$. Over the entire cross section, we know that

\[M = \int_A {(R - r)Ek\left( {\frac{{R - r}}{r}} \right)dA} \]

We know that $Ek$ and $R$ are constants, we can expand the expression as

\[M = Ek\left( R^2 \int_A \frac{dA}{r} - 2R \int_A dA + \int_A rdA \right)\]

The first integral is equivalent to $A/R$, and the second integral is $A$, and the third integral is simply $r_cA$, we can rewrite the expression as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: bending moment curved beam}
  M = EkA({r_c} - R)
\end{equation}

Solving for $Ek$ in \cref{eqn: bending moment curved beam}, substituting into the above equation, and solving for $\sigma$, we have

\[\sigma  = \frac{{M(R - r)}}{{Ar({r_c} - R)}}\]

where $\sigma$ is the nominal normal stress in the member.
From $y = R - r$ and $e = r_c - R$, we can rewrite equation 483 as

\begin{equation}
  \sigma  = \frac{{My}}{{Ae(R - y)}}
\end{equation}

These equations are called \emph{curved-beam formula}, which can be used to determine the normal-stress distribution in a curved member. Since the stress acts in the direction of the circumference of the beam, it is sometimes called \emph{circumferential stress}.

\section*{Summary}

When moment is applied perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body, bending occurs. First we discussed the deformations that happen in uniform bending, where the bending moment remains constant along the length. We learned that the deformation in the beam on the same cross section can be tensile or compressive depending on the location. We then relax the assumption, looking at nonuniform bending and deriving the relationship between bending moment, stress, and strain along the length of a beam. We also derive the relationship between shear force and shear stress on a bent beam.

We then consider the cases where the applied bending moment is not perpendicular to any axis of the cross section—inclined loading. This can be solved by using superposition. Finally, the topics of shear flow and shear center are covered.

\chapter{Analysis of Beam Deflection}

In certain engineering applications, it is more important to understand the deformation, or deflection, of a beam due to bending moment or shear force itself than the stresses generated from it. In previous sections we have developed a method to determine the normal and shear stresses in bending beams. However, we have not yet developed a method to determine the deflections themselves. In this section, we will determine the equation of the deflection curve and also find deflections at specific points along the axis of the beam.
Deflections are sometimes calculated in order to verify that they are within tolerable limits. For examples, specifications for the design of buildings usually place upper limits on the deflections, preventing cracks in ceilings and walls from large deformation. In the design of machines and aircraft, specifications may limit deflections in order to prevent undesirable vibrations.
There are mainly two methods widely used in calculating the deflection of the beam. The first method is based on using the relationship between the bending moment and the curvature in the beam. As we have discussed, the curvature of the beam is simply the second derivative of the deflection of the beam along its length and, therefore, to obtain the deflection curve, on must integrate the curvature of the beam. We will call this the \emph{direct integration approach}. The second method is based on the relationship between the strain energy in the bending beam and applied load. Therefore, this method is called the \emph{energy approach}.

\section{Direct Integration Approach}

For the purpose of discussion, we will assume that the beam has its original orientation along the x axis. The deflection, denoted with $v$, is the lateral deformation of the beam along the y axis at any position x along the length of the beam.
When the beam is bent, there is not only a deflection at each point along the axis but also a rotation. The angle of rotation $\theta$ of the axis of the beam is the angle between the x axis and the tangent to the deflection curve. If $\rho$ is the radius of curvature and $s$ is the length of the curve, we see that

\[ \rho d\theta  = ds \]

Therefore, the curvature $\kappa$ is given by the equation

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: deflection curve}
  \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{{d\theta }}{{ds}}
\end{equation}

The slope of the deflection curve is the first derivative $dv/dx$ of the deflection curve. Since both $dv$ and $dx$ are very small, the slope $dv/dx$ is simply the tangent of the angle of rotation. Thus

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: tan approx}
  \frac{{dv}}{{dx}} = \tan \theta
\end{equation}

In similar manner, we also obtain the following relationships:

\[\cos \theta  = \frac{{dx}}{{ds}} \text{ and } \sin \theta  = \frac{{dv}}{{ds}}\]

Since these derivations are based only upon geometric considerations, they are valid for beams of any material. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on the magnitudes of the slopes and deflections.
When we assume that the beam undergo only very small deflections and angles of rotation, in this case, it is acceptable to assume that the curvature of the beam is very small. For very small angle, $\cos\theta \approx 1$, giving

\[ds \approx dx\]

And so \cref{eqn: deflection curve} becomes

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: deflection curve 2}
  \kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{{d\theta }}{{dx}}
\end{equation}

Also, when the angle is small $\tan\theta \approx \theta$ so we can simplify \cref{eqn: tan approx} to

\[\theta  = \frac{{dv}}{{dx}}\]

Substituting this into \cref{eqn: deflection curve 2} and we have

\[\kappa  = \frac{1}{\rho } = \frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}\]

This equation is valid for a beam of any material provided the rotations are small.
If we assume that the material of a beam is linearly elastic and follows Hooke’s law, and that the curvature of the beam follows \cref{eqn: moment-curvature}, then we can derive the \emph{differential equation of the deflection curve} as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: diff equation of deflection}
  \frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} = \frac{M}{{EI}}
\end{equation}

This equation can be integrated to find the deflection, provided the bending moment $M$ and flexural rigidity $EI$ are known as a function of $x$.

Other equations can be obtained by replacing the bending moment $M$ with the shear force $V$ and the intensity of the distributed load $q$. We know that

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: shear force and load intensity}
  \frac{{dM}}{{dx}} = V \hspace{1cm} \frac{{dV}}{{dx}} =  - q
\end{equation}

In the case of a nonprismatic beam, the flexural rigidity $EI$ is varying along the length of the beam. We write \cref{eqn: diff equation of deflection} in the form

\[EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} = M\]

Differentiating both sides of this equation and substitute values from \cref{eqn: shear force and load intensity} gives

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \frac{d}{{dx}}\left( {EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}} \right) = V \hfill \\
    \frac{{{d^2}}}{{d{x^2}}}\left( {EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}} \right) = \frac{{dV}}{{dx}} =  - q \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

In the case of a prismatic beam, the differential equation reduces to

\begin{align}
    EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} &= M \nonumber \\
    EI\frac{{{d^3}v}}{{d{x^3}}} &= V \nonumber \\
    EI\frac{{{d^4}v}}{{d{x^4}}} &=  - q 
\end{align}

Each time we integrate produces one constant of integration. These constants can be solved for by imposing known conditions regarding the slopes and deflections. The conditions fall into one of these three categories: 1) boundary conditions, 2) continuity conditions, and 3) symmetry conditions.

\emph{Boundary conditions} pertain to the deflections and slopes at the supports of the beam. For example, a simple support keeps the deflection at zero, and at a fixed support both the deflection and slope are zero.

\emph{Continuity conditions} occur where the regions of integration meet. The deflection curve of any beam must be continuous and differentiable throughout its length. Thus, both its deflection and slope must be continuous throughout.

\emph{Symmetry conditions} may be available where supports and loading are symmetric. For example, if a simple beam supports a uniform load throughout its length, the beam's deflection must be symmetric. It can then be deduced that the slope of the deflection at the middle must be zero.

\begin{example}
  If we have a prismatic beam fixed on one end and a vertical load $P$ applied on the other end. What is the deflection curve of the beam and what is the maximum deflection if the beam has properties $E$ and $I$ throughout its length?

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw[fill=LightGrey] (0,-0.5) rectangle (1,2.5);
      \draw[fill=SkyBlue] (1,0.75) rectangle (7,1.25);
      \draw[<-, ultra thick] (7,1.25) -- ++(90:1) node[above]{$P$};
      \draw[|<->|] (1, 0.25) -- (4,0.25) node[below]{$L$} --  (7, 0.25);

      \draw[->] (1,1.75) -- (2,1.75) node[above left]{$x$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{figure}
  
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
First we must determine the bending moment inside the cross section along the length. Using the method of sections, we can determine that

\[M(x) =  - P(L - x)\]	

We can determine the deflection curve by integrating twice on the equation and apply boundary conditions on the fixed end

\[\begin{gathered}
  EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} = M(x) =  - P(L - x) \hfill \\
  EI\frac{{dv}}{{dx}} = \frac{P}{2}{(L - x)^2} + {C_1} \hfill \\
  \frac{{dv}}{{dx}} = 0\;{\text{at }}x = 0 \hfill \\
  {C_1} =  - \frac{{P{L^2}}}{2} \hfill \\
  EI\frac{{dv}}{{dx}} = \frac{P}{2}{(L - x)^2} - \frac{{P{L^2}}}{2} \hfill \\
  EIv =  - \frac{P}{6}{(L - x)^3} - \frac{{P{L^2}x}}{2} + {C_2} \hfill \\
  v = 0\;{\text{at}}\;x = 0 \hfill \\
  {C_2} = \frac{{P{L^3}}}{6} \hfill \\
  v =  - \frac{P}{{6EI}}{(L - x)^3} - \frac{{P{L^2}x}}{{2EI}} + \frac{{P{L^3}}}{{6EI}} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

The maximum deflection, naturally, is at the free end. Its value is

\[v(L) =  - \frac{{P{L^3}}}{{2EI}} + \frac{{P{L^3}}}{{6EI}} =  - \frac{{P{L^3}}}{{3EI}}\]

Note that the negative sign means the deflection is downward.
\end{solution}

\subsection{Deflections by integration of the shear force and load equations}

The equation of the deflection curve may also be obtained by integrating the differential equation in terms of the shear force $V$ and the load $q$. The procedure for solving the load or the shear force equation is similar to that for solving the bending moment equation, except that more integrations are needed. This also leads to more constants of integrations. Just like before, the constants can be solved through the application of boundary, continuity, and symmetry conditions. However, these conditions now include conditions on the shear forces and bending moments as well as conditions on the slopes and deflections.
Conditions on the shear forces are equivalent to conditions on the third derivative. In a similar manner, conditions on the bending moments are equivalent to the conditions on the second derivative. Once these have been applied, we will have enough conditions to solve for all constants of integrations.

\section{Energy Approach}

\subsection{Strain Energy of Bending}

The general concepts of strain energy were discussed previously for bar subjected to axial loads and shaft under torsion. In this section, we will apply the same concepts to beams. Since we will be using the equations for curvature and deflection derived earlier, we will have to keep the assumptions that the material is linearly elastic and that the deflections and rotations are small.

Consider first a simple beam in pure bending under the action for two coupling moments of magnitude $M$ each. The deflection curve is a circular arc of constant curvature $\kappa = M/EI$. The angle $\theta$ subtended by the arc equals $L/\rho$, where $L$ is the length of the beam and $\rho$ is the radius of curvature. Therefore, we have

\[\theta  = \frac{L}{\rho } = \kappa L = \frac{{ML}}{{EI}}\]

This linear relationship between the moments $M$ and the angle $\theta$ shows that as bending moment increases, they perform work $W$ represented by the shaded area below the curve $M-\theta$. This work is equal to the strain energy $U$ stored in the beam, so we have

\[W = U = \frac{{M\theta }}{2}\]

By combining equation 5115 and 5116, we can express the strain energy stored in a beam in pure bending in these terms

\[U = \frac{{{M^2}L}}{{2EI}} = \frac{{EI{\theta ^2}}}{{2L}}\]

The equation represents the strain energy in terms of either the bending moment or the angle of rotation. However, if the bending moment in a beam varies along its length (if shear force is present), then we may obtain the strain energy by applying equation 5117 to an element of the beam and integrating along the length. We know that

\[d\theta  = \kappa dx = \frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}dx\]

Therefore, the strain energy $dU$ of the element is given by these equations

\[\begin{gathered}
  dU = \frac{{{M^2}dx}}{{2EI}} \hfill \\
  dU = \frac{{EI{{(d\theta )}^2}}}{{2dx}} = \frac{{EI}}{{2dx}}{\left( {\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}dx} \right)^2} = \frac{{EI}}{2}{\left( {\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}} \right)^2}dx \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

The strain energy is then simply the integration of the strain energy of the element throughout the length of the beam, so that

\[\begin{gathered}
  U = \int {\frac{{{M^2}dx}}{{2EI}}}  \hfill \\
  U = \int {\frac{{EI}}{2}{{\left( {\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}}} \right)}^2}dx}  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

We can use the first equation to find the strain energy in the beam when we know the bending moment as a function of the beam, or we can use the second equation when we know the deflection curve.

\subsection{Castigliano’s theorem}

This theorem provides a method for finding the deflections of a structure from its strain energy. The theorem simply states that the derivative of the strain energy with respect the load is equal to the deflection corresponding to the load. The derivation of Castigliano’s theorem will show what the theorem physically represents.

Consider a beam subjected to n number of loads $P_1, P_2, …, P_n$. The deflections of the beam corresponding to the various loads are denoted $\delta_1, \delta_2, ..., \delta_n$. We will assume that the principle of superposition is applicable to the beam and its loads.

Now we will determine the strain energy of this beam. When the loads are applied to the beam, they gradually increase in magnitude from zero to their maximum values. Simultaneously, as the load is applied, it moves through the corresponding displacement and does work. The total work done by the loads is equal to the strain energy $U$ stored in the beam, $W = U$. Note that $W$ is a function of the loads acting on the beam.

Next, assume one of the loads, $i$th load, is increased slightly by the amount $dP_i$ while the other loads are held constant. This increase in the load will cause a small increase in strain energy of the beam $dU$. This increase may be expressed as the rate of change of $U$ with respect to $P_i$ times the small increase in $P_i$. Thus, the increase in strain energy is

\[dU = \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}}d{P_i}\]

The final strain energy of the beam is

\[U + dU = U + \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}}d{P_i}\]

Because the principle of superposition holds for this beam, the total strain energy is independent of the order in which the loads are applied. Therefore, assume that we first apply the load $dP_i$, it will produce the strain energy equal to one-half the product of the load and its corresponding displacement $d\delta_i$. Thus, the amount of strain energy due to the load $dP_i$ is

\[\frac{{d{P_i}d{\delta _i}}}{2}\]

When the rest of the loads are applied, they produce the same displacement as before and do the same amount of work as before. However, during the application of these loads, the force dPi automatically moves through the displacement $\delta_i$. It therefore produces additional work equal to the product of the force and the distance (without the 1/2 factor since the full load acts throughout the displacement). Thus, the final strain energy for the second loading sequence is

\[\frac{{d{P_i}d{\delta _i}}}{2} + U + d{P_i}{\delta _i}\]

But this quantity is the same as the strain energy from the first loading sequence, namely when the load dPi is applied last, so that

\[\frac{{d{P_i}d{\delta _i}}}{2} + U + d{P_i}{\delta _i} = U + \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}}d{P_i}\]

We discard the first term because it contains the product of two differentials and are much smaller than other quantities. We then obtain the following relationship.

\begin{equation}
  \delta_i = \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}}
\end{equation}

This equation is known as \emph{Castigliano’s second theorem}.
Castigliano’s first theorem, which states that

\[{P_i} = \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {\delta_i}}}\]

can also be proven using a similar method.

\subsection{The use of a fictitious load}

According to Castigliano’s theorem, the only displacement that can be found are those that correspond to loads acting on the structure. If we want to calculate a displacement at a point where there is no applied load, then a fictitious load corresponding to the desired displacement must be applied to the structure. We can then determine the displacement by evaluating the strain energy and taking the partial derivative with respect to the fictitious load. The result is the displacement produced by the actual loads and the fictitious load acting simultaneously. By setting the fictitious load to zero, we then obtain the displacement produced only by the actual loads.

\subsection{Differentiation under the integral sign}

The use of Castigliano’s theorem for determining beam deflections may lead to lengthy integrations, especially when more than two loads act on the beam. Since finding the strain energy requires the integration of the square of the bending moment. After the integrations are completed and the strain energy has been determined, we differentiate the strain energy to obtain the deflections. However, we can bypass this step of finding the strain energy by differentiating before integrating. This procedure does not eliminate the integrations, but it does make them much simpler.

To derive this method, we begin with the equation for the strain energy and apply Castigliano’s theorem:
\[{\delta _i} = \frac{{\partial U}}{{\partial {P_i}}} = \frac{\partial }{{\partial {P_i}}}\int {\frac{{{M^2}dx}}{{2EI}}} \]

Using the rules of calculus, we can differentiate the integral by differentiating under the integration sign:

\begin{equation}
  {\delta _i} = \frac{\partial }{{\partial {P_i}}}\int {\frac{{{M^2}dx}}{{2EI}}}  = \int {\left( {\frac{M}{{EI}}} \right)} \left( {\frac{{\partial M}}{{\partial {P_i}}}} \right)dx
\end{equation}

In this case, we integrate the product of the bending moment and its derivative, thus the integration is much simpler.

\begin{example}
Assume again that we have the prismatic beam with bending modulus $EI$ with one end fixed and the other free. Load $P$ is applied downward at the free end. Use Castigliano’s theorem to determine its maximum deflection.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
The maximum deflection is at the free end. We know that the bending moment at any length $x$ is

\[M(x) =  - P(L - x)\]

This allows us to compute the deflection directly by employing equation 5128, thus

\begin{align*}
  {\delta _i} &= \int {\left( {\frac{M}{{EI}}} \right)\left( {\frac{{\partial M}}{{\partial {P_i}}}} \right)dx} \\ 
              &= \frac{1}{{EI}}\int_0^L { - P(L - x)[ - (L - x)]dx}  \\ 
              &= \frac{P}{{EI}}\left[ {{L^2}x - {x^2}L + \frac{{{x^3}}}{3}} \right]_0^L \\ 
              &= \frac{{P{L^3}}}{{3EI}} 
\end{align*}	

Note that we have the same answer as that of the direct integration method. The only difference is the sign. Using Castigliano's theorem, positive deflections indicate that it is in the same direction as the force, which is downward.
\end{solution}

\section*{Summary}

This chapter presents two methods that can be used to determine lateral deflection of a beam as a result of bending moment, shear force, or distributed load. One is the direct integration, which relates the lateral deflection to the curvature of the beam. By solving for the deflection using ordinary differential equation, one must apply the correct boundary conditions to arrive at a correct solution. In this case, the conditions are the ones exerted by the supports. The other method is the energy method or Castigliano’s theorem where the strain energy stored in a bent beam is related to its lateral deflection.

\chapter{Analysis of Multiaxial Stress} \label{chapter: multiaxial stress}

In this section, we will show how to transform the stress components that are associated with a particular coordinate system into ones associated with another coordinate system. Once the transformation equation have been established, we can use them to obtain the maximum normal and shear stress components at a point and find the orientation of the element on which they act.

\section{Plane Stress}

Normally, the state of stress at a point in a body is defined by six independent normal and shear stresses. However, this is rarely encountered in real life, as we usually approximate and simplify so that the stress can be analyzed in a single plane. This is called \emph{plane stress}, illustrated in \cref{fig: plane stress element}. In this case, it is assumed that there is no load on the surface of a body and the corresponding stress components (both normal and shear) in the out-of-plane direction are zero. Therefore, the only three components of stress left are $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\tau_{xy}$ which act on the sides of the element.

\section{Stress Transformation for Plane Stress}

The method of transforming the normal and shear stress components from the $x$, $y$ to $x’$, $y’$ coordinate axes will now be developed in a general manner and expressed as a set of stress transformation equations.

\paragraph{Sign Convention:} Before the transformation equations are derived, we must first establish a sign convention for the stress components. A normal or shear stress component is positive when it acts in a positive direction on a positive face, or it acts in a negative direction on a negative face. The stress component is negative otherwise.

Given the state of plane stress, the orientation of the inclined plane on which the normal and shear stress components are to be determined will be defined using $\theta$. Note that both coordinate systems $x$-$y$ and $x’$-$y’$ must form right-handed coordinate systems, meaning the cross product $x \times y$ must give the direction of $z$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/stress-transformation}
  \caption{Derivation of stress transformation equation by cutting element at an angle.}
  \label{fig: stress transformation}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Normal and Shear Stress Components:} The element is sectioned into a right-angle triangle with an angle of $\theta$ on the top as in the figure below. The resulting normal and shear stress on the newly sectioned side can be determined using equation of force equilibrium as

\[ \begin{gathered}
  \sum {F_{x'}}  = 0; \hfill \\[1em]
  \begin{split}
    {\sigma _{x'}}\Delta A - ({\tau _{xy}}\Delta A\sin \theta )\cos \theta  &- ({\sigma _y}\Delta A\sin \theta )\sin \theta  \\
    &- ({\tau _{xy}}\Delta A\cos \theta )\sin \theta  - ({\sigma _x}\Delta A\sin \theta )\cos \theta  = 0
  \end{split} \nonumber \\[0.5em]
  {\sigma _{x'}} = {\sigma _x}{\cos ^2}\theta  + {\sigma _y}{\sin ^2}\theta  + 2{\tau _{xy}}\sin \theta \cos \theta  \\[1em]
  \sum {{F_{y'}}}  = 0; \hfill \\ 
  {\tau _{x'y'}} = ({\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y})\sin \theta \cos \theta  + {\tau _{xy}}({\cos ^2}\theta  - {\sin ^2}\theta ) \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Once we know $\sigma_{x’}, \sigma_{y’}$ can be obtained simply by substituting $\theta$ with 90 + $\theta$

\[{\sigma _{y'}} = {\sigma _x}{\sin ^2}\theta  + {\sigma _y}{\cos ^2}\theta  - 2{\tau _{xy}}\sin \theta \cos \theta \]

If we know the stress components for all possible orientations of faces through a point, we say that we know the \emph{state of stress} at a point.

\section{Mohr’s Circle for Stress Transformation}

The stress transformation can be made easier to understand through the use of a graphical representation. However, first we have to rewrite stress transformation using double angle formulas.

\[\begin{gathered}
  {\sigma _{x'}} = {\sigma _x}{\cos ^2}\theta  + {\sigma _y}{\sin ^2}\theta  + 2{\tau _{xy}}\sin \theta \cos \theta  \hfill \\
  {\sigma _{x'}} = \frac{{{\sigma _x}}}{2}(1 + \cos 2\theta ) + \frac{{{\sigma _y}}}{2}(1 - \cos 2\theta ) + {\tau _{xy}}\sin 2\theta  \hfill \\
  {\sigma _{x'}} - \left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right) = \left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)\cos 2\theta  + {\tau _{xy}}\sin 2\theta  \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

\[\begin{gathered}
  {\tau _{x'y'}} = ({\sigma _y} - {\sigma _x})\sin \theta \cos \theta  + {\tau _{xy}}({\cos ^2}\theta  - {\sin ^2}\theta ) \\
  {\tau _{x'y'}} = \left( {\frac{{{\sigma _y} - {\sigma _x}}}{2}} \right)\sin 2\theta  + {\tau _{xy}}\cos 2\theta \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Square both expressions and add them together, we have

\begin{align*}
  {\left[ {{\sigma _{x'}} - \left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)} \right]^2} + \tau _{x'y'}^2 = &{\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)^2}{\cos ^2}2\theta  + 2\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right){\tau _{xy}}\cos 2\theta \sin 2\theta  + \tau _{xy}^2{\sin ^2}2\theta \\
  + &{\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)^2}{\sin ^2}2\theta  + 2\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _y} - {\sigma _x}}}{2}} \right){\tau _{xy}}\cos 2\theta \sin 2\theta  + \tau _{xy}^2{\cos ^2}2\theta \\ 
\end{align*}

Simplifying the expression using trigonometry identities, we have

\[{\left[ {{\sigma _{x'}} - \left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)} \right]^2} + \tau _{x'y'}^2 = {\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)^2} + \tau _{xy}^2\]

Since $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\tau_{xy}$ are known quantities for the problem, we can rewrite the expression as

\begin{equation}
  {({\sigma _{x'}} - {\sigma _{avg}})^2} + \tau _{x'y'}^2 = {R^2}
\end{equation}

Note that this equation represents a circle having radius $R$ and center on the $\sigma$ axis at point ($\sigma_{avg}$, 0).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/mohrs-circle}
  \caption{Mohr's circle and its representation of state of stress.}
  \label{fig: mohr's circle}
\end{figure}

This extremely useful graphical representation for stress transformation was developed by a German engineer Otto Mohr and is therefore called \emph{Mohr’s circle}.
The original state of stress can be determined by

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: principal direction}
  2{\theta _p} = {\tan ^{ - 1}}\frac{{2{\tau _{xy}}}}{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}
\end{equation}

where $\theta _p$ is called the \emph{principal direction}. And when determining the stress components in the material at angle $\alpha$ from its original coordinate system, simply draw the line from the center of the circle at angle $2\alpha$ from the original state to determine stress components at this new orientation.

\subsection{Principal Stresses for Plane Stress}

Considering the two points where the circle crosses the $\sigma$ axis, these two points are where the two normal stress components are at maximum and minimum. These two stresses are called the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively. We can represent them in terms of stresses in plane stress as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: principal stresses}
  {\sigma _{1,2}} = \frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2} \pm \sqrt {{{\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}}^2} + \tau _{xy}^2}
\end{equation}

Also note that the shear stress component is zero in this orientation.

\subsection{Maximum In-Plane Shear Stresses}

At the highest point of the circle represents the maximum shear stress and its orientation. We can represent the maximum shear stress in terms of stresses in plane stress as

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: max shear stress}
  {\tau _{xy}} = \sqrt {{{\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)}^2} + \tau _{xy}^2}
\end{equation}

Since the angle between the principal stresses and maximum shear stress on Mohr’s circle is 90 degree, the actual angle between the principal stress plane and maximum shear stress plan is 45. Also note that the normal component stresses are equal to $\sigma_{avg}$.

\begin{example} State of stress of a plane stress element \label{example: plane stress}
  
  Determine the principal stresses, maximum shear stress, and the principal direction in this element

    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{pictures/Static-body-load-analysis/plane-stress-example}
    \caption[]{\Cref{example: plane stress}}
  \end{figure}
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
  To determine the maximum shear stress, simply substitute the values into \cref{eqn: max shear stress} and obtain
  
  \begin{align*}
    {\tau _{xy}} &= \sqrt {{{\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)}^2} + \tau _{xy}^2}  \\ 
                 &= \sqrt {{{\left( {\frac{{20 - ( - 30)}}{2}} \right)}^2} + {{25}^2}}  \\ 
                 &= 35.4 {\text{ MPa}} 
  \end{align*}
  
  The principal stresses are

  \begin{align*}
    {\sigma _{1,2}} &= \frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2} \pm \sqrt {{{\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}}^2} + \tau _{xy}^2}  \\ 
                    &= \frac{{20 - 30}}{2} \pm 35.4 \\ 
                    &= 30.4\;{\text{MPa}},\; - 40.4\;{\text{MPa}} 
  \end{align*}
  
  The principal direction is

  \begin{align*}
    2\theta  &= {\tan ^{ - 1}}\frac{{2{\tau _{xy}}}}{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}} \\ 
             &= 0.785 \\ 
    \theta  &= 0.393\;{\text{rad}} \\ 
             &= {22.5\degree }
  \end{align*}
\end{solution}

\section{Hooke’s Law for Plane Stress}

We have previously investigated the stresses in a plane-stress element. We will now use them in combination with Hooke’s law to derive the strains in the material. Here, we will have to assume that the material is uniform throughout the body and has the same properties in all directions.

Consider the normal strains $\varepsilon_x$, $\varepsilon_y$, and $\varepsilon_z$ in plane stress. Each strain is the summation of effects of individual stresses. For example, the strain $\varepsilon_x$ due to the stress $\sigma_x$ is $\sigma_x / E$ where $E$ is the modulus of elasticity. Also, the strain $\varepsilon_x$ due to the stress $\sigma_y$ is equal to $-\nu \sigma_y / E$ where $\nu$ is the Poisson’s ratio. Since there is no stress in the $z$ direction and the shear stresses produce no normal strains, we have the resultant strain in the x direction is
\begin{equation}
  {\varepsilon _x} = \frac{1}{E}({\sigma _x} - \nu {\sigma _y})
\end{equation}
And in a similar manner, we obtain the strains in the $y$ and $z$ directions as:
\begin{align}
  {\varepsilon _y} &= \frac{1}{E}({\sigma _y} - \nu {\sigma _x}) \\
  {\varepsilon _z} &=  - \frac{\nu }{E}({\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y})
\end{align}
These equations may be used to find the normal strains when the stresses are known.

The shear stress causes a distortion of the element. The shear strain $\tau_{xy}$ is the decrease in angle between the $x$ and $y$ faces of the element and is related to the shear stress by Hooke’s law in shear as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma _{xy} = \frac{{{\tau _{xy}}}}{G}
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the shear modulus of elasticity. Note that the normal stresses have no effect on the shear strain.

Equations 6140 and 6141 can be solved simultaneously for the stresses in terms of the strains, so we have:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _x} = \frac{E}{{1 - {\nu ^2}}}({\varepsilon _x} + \nu {\varepsilon _y}) \hfill \\
    {\sigma _y} = \frac{E}{{1 - {\nu ^2}}}({\varepsilon _y} + \nu {\varepsilon _x}) \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

These equations may be used to find the stresses in plane stress when the strains are known.

\subsection{Special cases of Hooke’s law}

In the special case of biaxial stress, we only have normal stresses in the $x$ and $y$ directions. There is no normal stress in the out-of-plane direction and there is no shear stress at all. In this case, Hooke’s law for plane stress simplifies to
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\varepsilon _x} = \frac{1}{E}({\sigma _x} - \nu {\sigma _y}) \hfill \\
    {\varepsilon _y} = \frac{1}{E}({\sigma _y} - \nu {\sigma _x}) \hfill \\
    {\varepsilon _z} =  - \frac{\nu }{E}({\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}) \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
And the corresponding normal stresses are:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _x} = \frac{E}{{1 - {\nu ^2}}}({\varepsilon _x} + \nu {\varepsilon _y}) \hfill \\
    {\sigma _y} = \frac{E}{{1 - {\nu ^2}}}({\varepsilon _y} + \nu {\varepsilon _x}) \hfill
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

For uniaxial stress, there is only a normal stress in the $x$ direction, the equations of Hooke’s law simplify further to:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\varepsilon _x} = \frac{1}{E}({\sigma _x} - \nu {\sigma _y}) \hfill \\
    {\varepsilon _y} = {\varepsilon _z} =  - \frac{\nu }{E}{\sigma _x} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Unit volume change}

The unit volume change at a point in a strained body can be found by considering the deformed element. Assume that the original volume of this element is $V_0 = abc$, its final volume is

\[{V_1} = abc(1 + {\varepsilon _x})(1 + {\varepsilon _y})(1 + {\varepsilon _z})\]

Expanding the expression, we have

\[{V_1} = abc(1 + {\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _z} + {\varepsilon _x}{\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _x}{\varepsilon _z} + {\varepsilon _y}{\varepsilon _z} + {\varepsilon _x}{\varepsilon _y}{\varepsilon _z})\]

Since we assume that the strains are very small, we can ignore the products of the small strains and the final volume becomes

\[{V_1} = abc(1 + {\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _z})\]

Therefore, the change in volume is

\[\Delta V = {V_1} - {V_0} = abc({\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _z})\]

And the unit volume change, or dilatation, becomes

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: 2d dilatation}
  e = \frac{{\Delta V}}{{{V_0}}} = {\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _z}
\end{equation}

This equation gives the dilatation in terms of the normal strains and is valid for any material provided the strains are small. Observe once again that shear strains produce no change in volume. When the material follows Hooke’s law, we can substitute equations 6140 and 6141 into equation 6151 and obtain the following expression for the unit volume change in plane stress in terms of the stresses:

\begin{equation}
  e = \frac{{\Delta V}}{{{V_0}}} = \frac{{1 - 2\nu }}{E}({\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y})
\end{equation}
  
Having this expression for $e$, we can find the volume change for any object subjected to plane stress by integrating throughout its volume.

\section{Triaxial Stress}

When an element of material is subjected to normal stresses in all three perpendicular directions and there are no shear stresses in the faces, the element is said to be in a state of triaxial stress. Since there are no shear stresses, the three normal stresses are the principal stresses in the material.

From our previous discussion of plane stresses, we know that the maximum shear stresses occur on planes oriented at 45 degree to the principal plane. Therefore, for a material in triaxial stress, the maximum shear stresses occur on elements oriented at angles of 45 degree to the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. Therefore, the maximum shear stresses obtained by the rotation about the axes are

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {({\tau _{\max }})_z} =  \pm \frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2} \hfill \\
    {({\tau _{\max }})_x} =  \pm \frac{{{\sigma _y} - {\sigma _z}}}{2} \hfill \\
    {({\tau _{\max }})_y} =  \pm \frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _z}}}{2} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The absolute maximum shear stress is the numerically the largest of the stresses from equation 6153.

\subsection{Hooke’s law for triaxial stress}

If the material follows Hooke’s law, we can obtain the relationships between the normal stresses and normal strains by using the same procedure as for plane stress. The strains produced by the stresses $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$ acting independently are superimposed to obtain the resultant strains. We can then derive the equations for strains in triaxial stress as follow:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\varepsilon _x} = \frac{{{\sigma _x}}}{E} - \frac{\nu }{E}({\sigma _y} + {\sigma _z}) \hfill \\
    {\varepsilon _y} = \frac{{{\sigma _y}}}{E} - \frac{\nu }{E}({\sigma _x} + {\sigma _z}) \hfill \\
    {\varepsilon _z} = \frac{{{\sigma _z}}}{E} - \frac{\nu }{E}({\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}) \hfill 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

These equations can then be solved simultaneously for the stresses in terms of the strains.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _x} = \frac{E}{{(1 + \nu )(1 - 2\nu )}}\left[ {(1 - \nu ){\varepsilon _x} + \nu ({\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _z})} \right] \hfill \\
    {\sigma _y} = \frac{E}{{(1 + \nu )(1 - 2\nu )}}\left[ {(1 - \nu ){\varepsilon _y} + \nu ({\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _z})} \right] \hfill \\
    {\sigma _z} = \frac{E}{{(1 + \nu )(1 - 2\nu )}}\left[ {(1 - \nu ){\varepsilon _z} + \nu ({\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _y})} \right] \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

These equations are also known as \emph{Hooke’s law for triaxial stress}.

\subsection{Unit Volume Change}

From \cref{eqn: 2d dilatation} the unit volume change is simply the sum of the normal stresses so that

\begin{equation}
  e = \frac{{\Delta V}}{{{V_0}}} = {\varepsilon _x} + {\varepsilon _y} + {\varepsilon _z}
\end{equation}

In triaxial stress, since all three normal stresses exist without any shear stress, the unit volume change corresponding to those stress are

\begin{equation}
  e = \frac{{1 - 2\nu }}{E}({\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y} + {\sigma _z})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Spherical stress}

In a special case of triaxial stress where all three perpendicular stresses are of the same magnitude, the material is said to be under \emph{spherical stress} or \emph{hydrostatic stress}. In this case, the stresses can be written as

\[{\sigma _x} = {\sigma _y} = {\sigma _z} = {\sigma _o}\]

Intuitively, the normal strains are also equal.

\[{\varepsilon _x} = {\varepsilon _y} = {\varepsilon _z} = {\varepsilon _o} = \frac{{{\sigma _o}}}{E}(1 - 2\nu )\]

The unit volume change or dilatation under spherical stress is

\begin{equation}
  e = 3{\varepsilon _o} = \frac{{3{\sigma _o}}}{E}(1 - 2\nu )
\end{equation}

The constant of the ratio between the spherical stress and unit volume change is

\begin{equation}
  K = \frac{E}{{3(1 - 2\nu )}}
\end{equation}

where $K$ is called the \emph{volume modulus of elasticity} or \emph{bulk modulus}.

\begin{example}
A 0.25-m$^3$ cube is being submerged under water where the water pressure is 30 MPa. If the material has $E$ = 3 GPa and Poisson’s ratio of 0.3, find the final volume of the element.
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
Hydrostatic pressure situation represents the state where the pressure is equal in all direction, this means that we can assume that the element is under spherical stress. The unit volume change is

\begin{align*}
  e &= \frac{{3{\sigma _o}}}{E}(1 - 2\nu ) \\ 
    &= \frac{{3(30 \times {{10}^6}\;Pa)(1 - 2(0.3))}}{{(3 \times {{10}^9}\;Pa)}} \\ 
    &= 0.012 
\end{align*}	

This means that the volume reduced by 1.2\% (since hydrostatic pressure in this case is compressive), and thus the final volume is

\begin{align*}
  {V_f} &= (1 - e)V \\ 
        &= 0.988(0.25 \text{ m}^3) \\ 
        &= 0.247 \text{ m}^3
  \end{align*}

\end{solution}

\subsection{Absolute Maximum Shear Stress}

In any three-dimensional element, we can determine the 3 principal stresses so that the element is in an equivalent trixial stress state. Though the method of determining three dimensional principal stresses are beyond the scope of this material, we can make simplifying assumptions using plane stress to understand its concept.

Consider a material subjected to in-plane principal stresses $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. If we look at the element in two dimensions, then we can use Mohr's circle to determine the maximum in-plane shear stress for each of the planes $x$-$y$, $x$-$z$, and $y$-$z$. We can furthermore determine the \emph{absolute maximum shear stress} in the material, which is equal to half of the biggest difference among the three principal stresses. In other words, for a plane stress element where $\sigma_1 > \sigma_2$, we have that

\begin{equation}
  \tau_{max,abs} = \left\{
    \begin{gathered}
      \dfrac{\sigma_1}{2} \hspace{1.5cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} > 0 \\[10pt]
      \dfrac{\sigma_1 - \sigma_2}{2} \hfill \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma_1}{\sigma_2} < 0
    \end{gathered}
  \right.
\end{equation}

Calculating this absolute maximum shear stress as shown here will be crucial when designing components from a ductile material, since its strength mainly depends on its ability to resist shear stress. A more detailed discussion of ductile material strength and failure take place in \cref{section: yield and fracture}.

\section{Plane Strain}

A general state of strain can, just like a state of stress, be represented by a combination of three component of normal strains and three shear strains, $\varepsilon_x$, $\varepsilon_y$, $\varepsilon_z$, $\gamma_{xy}$, $\gamma_{xz}$, and $\gamma_{yz}$. Also strains, like stresses, vary according to the orientation of the element. Strains at a point are often determined using strain gages, which measure strain in specified directions. However, we sometimes need to obtain strain in other directions. Thaat is where \emph{strain transformation} comes in.

Three dimensional strain transformation is beyond the scope of this material. In our case, we will simplify the process for a \emph{plane strain} element. Similar to its plane stress counterpart, a plane strain element has no normal strain in the $z$ direction and no out-of-plane shear strains $\gamma_{xz}$ and $\gamma_{yz}$.

It is important to realize that plane stress does not cause plane strain or vice versa.

\section{Plane-Strain Transformation}

It is important in plane-strain analysis to establish equations to determine the $x'$, $y'$, and shear strain in the $x'y'$ plane at a point when the $x$, $y$ components of strain are known. Unlike plane-stress transformation that can be solved by equilibrium, this is a geometry-based problem, requiring us to show how the changes in lengths of the element vary according to its orientation.

To develop the strain transformation equation for $\varepsilon_{x'}$, we must determine the elongation of a line segment $dx'$ that lies aong th e$x'$ axis and is subjected to strain components $\varepsilon_x$, $\varepsilon_y$, and $\gamma_{xy}$. As illustrated in figure ..., the components of the line $dx'$ along the $x$ and $y$ axes are

\begin{align*}
  dx &= dx' \cos \theta \\
  dy &= dx' \sin \theta
\end{align*}

When there is a positive normal strain $\varepsilon_x$ on the material, the line $dx$ is elongated by $\varepsilon_x dx$, which causes $dx'$ to elongate by $\varepsilon_x dx \cos \theta$. Similarly, when $\varepsilon_y$ occurs, line $dy$ elongates by $\varepsilon_y dy$, causing $dy'$ to elongates by $\varepsilon_y dy \sin \theta$. Finally, if we assume that $dx$ is fixed, the shear strain $\gamma_{xy}$, which is the change in angle between $dx$ and $dy$, causes the top of line $dy$ to move by $\gamma_{xy} dy$ to the right. This causes $dx'$ to elongate by $\gamma_{xy} dy \cos \theta$. If all three of these elongations are added togather, the resultant elongation of $dx'$, which we will call $\delta x'$, is

\begin{equation*}
  \delta x' = \varepsilon_x dx \cos \theta + \varepsilon_y dy \sin \theta + \gamma_{xy} dy \cos \theta
\end{equation*}

The normal strain along the $x'$ axis is simply

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: strain transformation in x unmod}
  \varepsilon_{x'} = \frac{\delta x'}{dx'} = \varepsilon_x \cos^2 \theta + \varepsilon_y \sin^2 \theta + \gamma_{xy} \sin \theta \cos \theta
\end{equation}

The strain transformation equation for $\varepsilon_{y'}$ can be proven similarly. The resulting equation can also be obtained by substituting $(\theta + 90\degree)$ for $\theta$ in \cref{eqn: strain transformation in x unmod}, which gives

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: strain transformation in y unmod}
  \varepsilon_{y'} = \varepsilon_x \sin^2 \theta + \varepsilon_y \cos^2 \theta - \gamma_{xy} \sin \theta \cos \theta
\end{equation}

Now, the strain transformation equation for $\gamma_{x'y'}$ can be derived considering the amount of rotation $dx'$ and $dy'$ undergo when subjected to the three plane strain components. First, let us consider the rotation of $dx'$, which is defined by a counterclockwise angle $\alpha$ shown in fig. ... It can be determined by the displacement caused by $\delta y'$ using $
\alpha = \delta y' / dx'$. To calculate $\delta y'$, consider the three displacement components acting in the $y'$ direction: $\varepsilon_x$ giving $-\varepsilon_x dy \cos \theta$; $\varepsilon_y$ giving $\varepsilon_y dy \cos \theta$; and $\gamma_{xy}$ giving $-\gamma_{xy} dy \sin \theta$. So $\delta y'$ caused by all three strain components is

\begin{equation*}
  \delta y' = - \varepsilon_x dx \sin \theta + \varepsilon_y dy \cos \theta - \gamma_{xy} dy \sin \theta
\end{equation*}

We can then obtain $\alpha = \delta y' / dx'$ by dividing though with $dx'$, giving

\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \left(-\varepsilon_x + \varepsilon_y \right) \sin \theta \cos \theta - \gamma_{xy}dy \sin \theta
\end{equation}

The line $dy'$ rotates by a counterclockwise angle $\beta$. Using a similar analysis, we obtain

\begin{equation*}
  \beta = - \left( - \varepsilon_x + \varepsilon_y \right) \cos \theta \sin \theta - \gamma_{xy} \cos^2 \theta
\end{equation*}

The shear strain $\gamma_{x'y'}$ is defined as the angle of change between $dx'$ and $dy'$, which can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
  \gamma_{x'y'} = \alpha - \beta = -2 \left( \varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y \right) \sin \theta \cos \theta + \gamma_{xy} ( \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta )
\end{equation}

Using trigonometric identities for double angles, we can rewrite the strain transformation equations in their final forms.

\begin{align}
  &\varepsilon_{x'} = \frac{\varepsilon_x + \varepsilon_y}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{2}\cos 2\theta + \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2}\sin 2\theta \\[10pt]
  &\varepsilon_{y'} = \frac{\varepsilon_x + \varepsilon_y}{2} - \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{2}\cos 2\theta - \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2}\sin 2\theta \\[10pt]
  &\frac{\gamma_{x'y'}}{2} = -\left( \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{2} \right) \sin 2\theta + \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2} \cos 2\theta
\end{align}

The similarity between these three equations and those of plane-stress transformation should be noted

\subsection{Principal Strains}

Just like stress, an element can be rotated so that there exist only normal strains with no shear strain. The corresponding strains are called the \emph{principal strains}, and if the mateial is isotropic, the orientation at which these strains occur will be identical to the principal direction.

Refering to the principal direction, \cref{eqn: principal direction}, and principal stress equations, \cref{eqn: principal stresses}, and the correspondence between stress and strain transformation equation, the principal direction and principal strains can be determined from

\begin{gather}
  \tan 2\theta_p = \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y} \\[10pt]
  \varepsilon_{1,2} = \frac{\varepsilon_x + \varepsilon_y}{2} \pm \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2} \right)^2 }
\end{gather}

\subsection{Maximum In-Plane Shear Strain}

Using the equations for the maximum in-plane shear stress and the analogy between stress and strain transformation, we can derive the maximum in-plane shear strain along with its direction from the following equations:

\begin{gather}
  \tan 2\theta_s = - \left( \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{\gamma_{xy}} \right) \\[10pt]
  \frac{\gamma_{\max}}{2} =  \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2} \right)^2 }
\end{gather}

\subsection{Mohr's Circle for Plane Strain}

As to be expected, since the plane-stress and plane-strain transformation equations are analogous, we can use Mohr's circle as a graphical tool to represent the state of strain and eliminate the angle $\theta$. The Mohr's circle for plane strain can be written in the form

\begin{equation}
  (\varepsilon_{x'} - \varepsilon_{avg})^2 + \left( \frac{\gamma_{x'y'}}{2} \right)^2 = R^2
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}
  \varepsilon_{\text{avg}} &= \frac{\varepsilon_x + \varepsilon_y}{2} \\[10pt]
  R &= \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\varepsilon_x - \varepsilon_y}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\gamma_{xy}}{2} \right)^2 }
\end{align*}

\section{Absolute Maximum Shear Strain}

Similar equations apply for absolute maximum shear strain as they do for its stress counterpart. For an element whose principal strains are $\varepsilon_1 > \varepsilon_2$, we have that

\begin{equation}
  \gamma_{\text{max, abs}} = \left\{
    \begin{gathered}
      \varepsilon_1 \hfill \text{when } \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} > 0 \\[10pt]
      \varepsilon_1 - \varepsilon_2 \hspace{0.5cm} \text{when } \frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2} < 0
    \end{gathered} \right.
\end{equation}

When the principal strains have the same sign, the absolute maximum shear strain is simply the maximum principal strain. If the principal strains have opposite signs, the absolute maximum shear strain is the difference between the two principal strains.

\section{Strain Rosette}

When performing a tensile test on a specimen, it is often the case that the normal strain is measured using a strain gage, which relies on the change in electrical resistance when it elongates or contracts. For the general state of strain on a body, the strains are determined using a network of three strain gages arranged in a pattern, also called a \emph{strain rossette}. Once the normal strains on the gages are measured, the results can be transformed to provide the state of stress at the point.

It is important to remember that on the surfaces on which the strain gages are attached, there are usually no out-of-plane stress, so the gages may be subjected to \emph{plane stress} but \emph{not} plane strain. However, the unmeasured out-of-plane strain should not affect other in-plane measurements. 

In general, the axes of the three gages are arranged at the angles $\theta_a$, $\theta_b$, and $\theta_c$. After the readings from the three strain gages $\varepsilon_a$, $\varepsilon_b$, and $\varepsilon_c$ are taken, we can apply the strain-transformation equation to determine the three plane-strain components.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \varepsilon_a = \varepsilon_x \cos^2 \theta_a + \varepsilon_y \sin^2 \theta_a + \gamma_{xy} \sin \theta_a \cos \theta_a \\[5pt]
    \varepsilon_b = \varepsilon_x \cos^2 \theta_b + \varepsilon_y \sin^2 \theta_b + \gamma_{xy} \sin \theta_b \cos \theta_b \\[5pt]
    \varepsilon_c = \varepsilon_x \cos^2 \theta_c + \varepsilon_y \sin^2 \theta_c + \gamma_{xy} \sin \theta_c \cos \theta_c
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

The values of $\varepsilon_x$, $\varepsilon_y$, $\gamma_{xy}$ are determined by solving these equations simultaneously. Once these components are determined, the principal strains and maximum shear strains can be determined.

\section*{Summary}

This chapter lays the foundation to analysis of multiaxial stress. Once there are more than one stresses acting on a body, one can no longer consider the stresses separately. The concept here is to find an ‘equivalent’ stress from the multiple stresses that can be used to determine the material failure. This is where the concept of principal stresses and maximum shear stress is useful.

The deformation of a body, however, can be considered using the principle of superposition. Simply find the deformation in each direction due to Hooke’s law and Poisson’s effect and add them up.

Finally, interesting cases in analysis of multiaxial stress are presented including 3D stress, volume change, and spherical stress.

\chapter{Analysis of Members under Combined Loadings}

Many members and structures in actual engineering applications are subjected to multiple simultaneous loadings. In this chapter, we will combine what we have discussed in previous chapters to determine stress distributions and deformations of members under combined loadings.

\section{Thin-Walled Pressure Vessels}

Cylindrical or spherical vessels are commonly used in industry to serve as boilers and tanks. When under pressure, the material of which they are made is subjected to a loading from all directions. Although this is the case, the vessel can be analyzed in a simpler manner provided it has a thin wall, meaning its wall thickness is much smaller than its radius of curvature.

When the vessel wall is thin, the stress distribution throughout its thickness will not vary significantly, and so we will assume that it is uniform or constant. Using this assumption, we will now analyze the state of stress in thin-walled cylindrical and spherical pressure vessels. The pressure in both cases is understood to be the \emph{gauge pressure}—the pressure above the atmospheric pressure.

\subsection{Cylindrical vessels}

Consider the vessel having a wall thickness $t$ and inner radius $r$. A gauge pressure $p$ is developed within the vessel by a contained gas or fluid, which is assumed to have negligible weight. Due to the uniformity of this loading, the wall is subjected to normal stresses $\sigma_c$ in the circumferential or hoop direction and $\sigma_l$ in the longitudinal or axial direction. Both of these stress components exert tension on the material. To determine the stress components, we will apply the method of sections and the equations of force equilibrium. For the hoop stress, consider the vessel to be sectioned perpendicular to its axis and in half as shown in \cref{fig: cylindrical vessel circumferential}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Combined-loadings/cylindrical-vessel-circ}
  \caption{Force balance between the circumferential stress in vessel's wall and internal pressure.}
  \label{fig: cylindrical vessel circumferential}
\end{figure}

Considering only the loading in $x$ direction, the pressure on the wall surface must be balanced by the hoop stress throughout the thickness of both walls. The total force from pressure on the wall surface is the same as the force on the vertical face of the sectioned gas. Therefore, we have

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    2\sigma _ctdy - p(2r)(dy) = 0 \\ 
    {\sigma _c} = \frac{{pr}}{t} \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

In order to obtain the longitudinal stress $\sigma_l$, we will consider the left portion the vessel as it is sectioned in the middle of the cylinder.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pictures/Combined-loadings/cylindrical-vessel-long}
  \caption{Force balance between longitudinal stress and internal pressure.}
  \label{fig: cylindrical vessel circumferential}
\end{figure}

Consider the force in the $y$ direction, we have

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _l}(2\pi rt) - p(\pi {r^2}) = 0 \\ 
    {\sigma _l} = \frac{{pr}}{{2t}} \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

It should be noted that the hoop stress is twice as large as the longitudinal stress.

\subsection{Spherical Vessels}

We can analyze a spherical vessel in a similar manner. Consider the vessel that has a wall thickness $t$ and inner radius $r$ and is subjected to an internal gauge pressure of $p$. If the vessel is sectioned in half, the resulting free body diagram illustrated in \cref{fig: spherical vessel} shows that the force resultant from pressure on the wall surface must be balanced by the force resultant from the circumferential or hoop stress. Thus, we have

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pictures/Combined-loadings/spherical-vessel}
  \caption{Force balance between the circumferential stress in spherical vessel's wall and internal pressure.}
  \label{fig: spherical vessel}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma }(2\pi rt) - p(\pi {r^2}) = 0 \\ 
    {\sigma } = \frac{{pr}}{{2t}} \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

By comparison, this is the same result obtained for the longitudinal stress in the cylindrical pressure vessel. Furthermore, this stress will be the same regardless of the orientation on the hemispheric free body diagram.

\begin{example}
A thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessel with thickness of 3 mm and diameter of 30 cm is pressurized with natural gas. If the vessel material has the maximum allowable stress of 100 MPa, what is the maximum pressure that the vessel can withstand?
\end{example}
\begin{solution}
The stresses on cylindrical pressure vessels due to internal pressure are always principal stresses. Therefore, we need only compare the maximum allowable stress to the maximum principal stress on the vessel, which is always the hoop/circumferential stress.

\begin{align*}
  {\sigma _c} &= \frac{{Pr}}{t} \\ 
  P &= \frac{{{\sigma _{\max }}t}}{r} \\ 
              &= \frac{{100 \times {{10}^6} \times 3 \times {{10}^{ - 3}}}}{{30 \times {{10}^{ - 2}}}} \\ 
              &= {10^6} \text{ Pa} = 1\text{ MPa} \\ 
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
\section{State of Stress Caused by Combined Loadings}

We have discussed the methods for determining stress distributions in a member subjected to an internal axial force, a shear force, a bending moment, or a torsional moment. In reality, however, the cross section of a member is subjected to several of these types of loadings simultaneously, and as a result, the method of superposition, if it applies, can be used to determine the resultant stress distributions caused by the loads. It must be noted that the principle only applies when there is a \emph{linear relationship} between the \emph{stress} and the \emph{loads} and when the member does not undergo significant deformation due to the loads.

Problems with multiaxial stress usually involves
\begin{enumerate}
\item a critical member with multiple loadings, each of which leads to a resultant stress. \emph{or}
\item a member with a single load, but due to the geometry of the member, the load causes multiple types of loading \emph{or}
\item a combination of the previous two.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Summary}

In this chapter, the concept in Chapter 6 is utilized. In the first part, one of the simplest and most used applications of multiaxial stress analysis is introduced: pressure vessels. We analyzed the principal stresses and maximum shear stresses depending on the internal pressure and vessel dimensions. In the second part, we open up to all types of possible problems which lead to multiaxial stress state: combined loadings. The key is to determine the types of loads on the cross section--whether forces or moments, determine the resulting stresses, and use the multiaxial stress analysis to determine the principal stresses and maximum shear stress.

\chapter{Introduction to Theories of Failure}

Material failures occur when solid materials lose their strength due to external loads. In this section, we will discuss theories that predict the failure of materials due to multiple types of loadings—multiaxial, repeated, or compressive. These theories are used to determine the allowable stresses reported in design codes. Keep in mind that no single theory can apply to all materials under all situations, and therefore we must also be able to apply the appropriate theory to the appropriate situation.

\section{Yield and Fracture} \label{section: yield and fracture}

In uniaxial state of stress, the material behavior during yield is relatively simple and can be explained by yield stress criteria. However, more generally, we must apply failure criteria under a multiaxial state of stress. The study of the materials that yield is known as plasticity theory. We only limit ourselves to the first third of plasticity theory—the prediction of yield initiation.
A yield criterion can be any descriptive statement that defines conditions under which yielding will occur. It may be expressed in terms of specific quantities, such as stress state, the strain state, a strain energy quantity, or others. To develop a yield function, the components of the multiaxial stress state are combined into a single quantity known as the effective stress . The effective stress is then compared with the yield stress , in some appropriate form, to determine if yield has occurred.

\subsection{Maximum shear stress theory (Tresca criteria)}

The most common cause of yielding of a ductile material is slipping, which occurs due to shear stress. If we make a specimen into a highly polished thin strip and subject it to a simple tension test, we can see that the slip planes will occur approximately 45 degree with the axis of the strip. This actually coincides with the direction of maximum shear stress in a uniaxial stress loading, indicating that ductile materials yield due to shear stress. The maximum shear stress in a material that is loaded to its shear stress is $\tau_{max} = S_y / 2$ where the yield stress is determined from a simple tension test.
For application we will express the absolute maximum shear stress in terms of the principal stresses. If the two in-plane principal stresses have the same sign (both compressive or both tensile), the failure will occur out of plane and so

\begin{equation}
  {\tau _{\max }} = \frac{{{\sigma _{\max }}}}{2}
\end{equation}

However, if the principal stresses have opposite signs, then failure occurs in the plane and so

\begin{equation}
  {\tau _{\max }} = \frac{{{\sigma _{\max }} - {\sigma _{\min }}}}{2}
\end{equation}

Using these equations, we can express the maximum shear stress theory for plane stress for any two in-plane principal stresses by the following criteria

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \begin{gathered}
      \left| {{\sigma _1}} \right| \leqslant {S_y} \hfill \\
      \left| {{\sigma _2}} \right| \leqslant {S_y} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered}  \hspace{1.5cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} > 0  \\
    \left| \sigma _1 - \sigma _2 \right| \leqslant S_y \hspace{0.6cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} < 0 \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pictures/Failure-theories/MSST-safe-zone}
  \caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under maximum shear stress criterion.}
  \label{fig: MSST safe zone}
\end{figure}

  \Cref{fig: MSST safe zone} illustrates safe combinations of principal stresses under maximum shear stress criterion. Note the difference in the between the ‘safe areas’ in the first and third quadrants, which are squares, and second and fourth quadrants, which are triangles. In the first and third quadrants, the principal stresses are both tensile (first) or compressive (third). The resulting maximum in-plane shear stress is small. Therefore, the material will fail under normal stress instead of shear stress. In the second and fourth quadrants, the two principal stress signs are opposite, resulting in a large in-plane shear stress. In this case, the material is limited by the shear stress and the safe areas reflect this.

For design equations, the failure condition under MSST with safety factor Ns can be written as

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \begin{gathered}
        \left| {{\sigma _1}} \right| > \frac{{{S_y}}}{{{N_s}}} \\
        \left| {{\sigma _2}} \right| > \frac{{{S_y}}}{{{N_s}}}  \\ 
      \end{gathered}  \hspace{1.5cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} > 0 \\
      \left| {\sigma _1} - {\sigma _2} \right| > \frac{S_y}{N_s} \hspace{0.6cm} \text{when } \dfrac{\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} < 0
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Maximum distortion energy theory (Von Mises criteria)}

We know that when a material deforms by an external loading, it stores energy internally throughout its volume. The energy per unit volume of material is called the strain-energy density, and if the material is subjected to a uniaxial stress, the strain energy density can be written as

\[u = \frac{1}{2}\sigma \varepsilon \]

Similarly, if the material is subjected to three principal stresses then the total strain energy density becomes

\[u = \frac{1}{2}({\sigma _1}{\varepsilon _1} + {\sigma _2}{\varepsilon _2} + {\sigma _3}{\varepsilon _3})\]

If the material behaves in a linear-elastic manner, we can apply Hooke’s law, which transforms the equation to

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: distortion energy density}
  u = \frac{1}{{2E}}\left[\sigma _1^2 + \sigma _2^2 + \sigma _3^2 - 2\nu ({\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} + {\sigma _1}{\sigma _3} + {\sigma _2}{\sigma _3})\right]
\end{equation}

This strain energy density can be considered as the sum of two parts, one part representing the energy needed to cause a volume change of the element with no change in shape, and the other representing the energy needed to distort the element. The energy stored in the form of volume change is a result of the average principal stress $\sigma_{avg} = \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 + \sigma_3$, since this stress causes equal principal strains in the material. The remaining portion of the stress $\sigma_1 – \sigma_{avg}$, $\sigma_2 – \sigma_{avg}$, $\sigma_3 – \sigma_{avg}$ causes the energy of distortion.

Experimental evidence has shown that materials do not yield when subjected to a uniform (hydrostatic) stress. M. Huber proposed that yielding in ductile material occurs when the \emph{distortion energy} per unit volume of the material equals or exceeds the distortion energy per unit volume of the same material when it is subjected to yielding in a simple tension test. This is called the \emph{maximum distortion energy theory}.
To obtain the distortion energy per unit volume, we substitute the distortion stresses into \cref{eqn: distortion energy density}. Expanding and simplifying, we have that

\[{u_d} = \frac{{1 + \nu }}{{6E}}\left[ {{{({\sigma _1} - {\sigma _2})}^2} + {{({\sigma _2} - {\sigma _3})}^2} + {{({\sigma _3} - {\sigma _1})}^2}} \right]\]

For uniaxial tension test, at yield, we have

\[{({u_d})_y} = \frac{{1 + \nu }}{{3E}}S_y^2\]

Since the theory requires that the distortion energy density be the same as the distortional energy from multiaxial stress state, we have

\begin{equation}
  {({\sigma _1} - {\sigma _2})^2} + {({\sigma _2} - {\sigma _3})^2} + {({\sigma _3} - {\sigma _1})^2} = 2S_y^2
\end{equation}

Or in the case of plane or biaxial stress, we have

\begin{equation}
  \sigma _e^2 = \sigma _1^2 - {\sigma _1}{\sigma _2} + \sigma _2^2 = S_y^2
\end{equation}

This equation represents an elliptical curve. Once the state of stress of a material falls outside the ellipse, the material is said to have failed.
In comparison the maximum distortion energy theory is slightly more aggressive in terms of yield prediction, as shown in \cref{fig: MDET safe zone}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{pictures/Failure-theories/MDET-safe-zone}
  \caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under maximum distortion energy criterion.}
  \label{fig: MDET safe zone}
\end{figure}

The safety factor according to the criterion can be written as

\begin{equation}
  {N_s}(MDET) = \frac{{{S_y}}}{{{\sigma _e}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{example} Failure of a plane-stress element

  A plane stress element having $\sigma_x = 50a$ MPa, $\sigma_y = 30a$ MPa and $\tau_{xy} =  25a$ MPa. If under uniaxial test, the material fails when the normal stress is 70 MPa, determine the maximum the value a that will cause the material to fail if it follows
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Maximum shear stress criterion
  \item Maximum distortion energy criterion
  \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}

  First, the uniaxial test indicates the material’s yield stress, which is 70 MPa. In either case, to determine the maximum a, we have to determine the element’s principal stresses

  \[\begin{gathered}
      {\sigma _{1,2}} = \frac{{{\sigma _x} + {\sigma _y}}}{2} \pm \sqrt {{{\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _x} - {\sigma _y}}}{2}} \right)}^2} - \tau _{xy}^2}  \\ 
      = \frac{{50a + 30a}}{2} \pm \sqrt {{{\left( {\frac{{50a - 30a}}{2}} \right)}^2} + {{(25a)}^2}}  \\ 
      = a\left[ {10 \pm \sqrt {{{10}^2} + {{25}^2}} } \right] \\ 
      = 37a,\; - 17a \\ 
    \end{gathered} \]
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item For maximum shear stress criterion, since the two principal stresses are of opposite signs, we know that the maximum stress is in-plane. We can apply equation so that
    
    \[\begin{gathered}
        {\sigma _1} - {\sigma _2} = {S_y} \hfill \\
        (37 - ( - 17))a = 70 \hfill \\
        a = 1.3 \hfill \\ 
      \end{gathered} \]
    
  \item For maximum distortional energy theory, we have that
    
    \[\begin{gathered}
        {({\sigma _1} - {\sigma _2})^2} + {({\sigma _2} - {\sigma _3})^2} + {({\sigma _3} - {\sigma _1})^2} = 2S_y^2 \\ 
        {(37a - ( - 17a))^2} + {( - 17a)^2} + {( - 37a)^2} = 2{(70)^2} \\ 
        4574{a^2} = 9800 \\ 
        a = 1.46 \\ 
      \end{gathered} \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

\subsection{Ductile Coulomb-Mohr theory}

Not all materials have the same compressive and tensile strengths. For example, the yield strengths of magnesium alloys in compression is approximately 50 percent of their yield strength in tension. The ultimate strength of grey cast irons in compression, on the other hand, can be as large as 300-400\% of their tensile strengths.
Mohr’s theory uses the results of three tests: tension, compression, and shear to construct three Mohr’s circles describing the state of stress at yield under the corresponding tests. Tangential lines connect the circles on the top and bottom of the circles to define a failure envelope of the theory.
A variation of Mohr’s theory, called the \emph{Coulomb-Mohr theory} or the \emph{internal-friction theory}, assume the tangential lines are straight. With this assumption, only the tensile and compressive strengths are necessary. Consider the conventional ordering of the principal stresses such that $\sigma_1 > \sigma_2 > \sigma_3$. The theory simply reduces to 

\[\frac{{{\sigma _1}}}{{{S_{ut}}}} - \frac{{{\sigma _3}}}{{{S_{uc}}}} = 1\]

For plane stress, when the two principal stresses $\sigma_A > \sigma_B > 0$, the failure condition become

\[{\sigma _A} > {S_{ut}}\]

When  $\sigma_A > 0 > \sigma_B$, the condition becomes

\[\frac{{{\sigma _A}}}{{{S_{ut}}}} - \frac{{{\sigma _B}}}{{{S_{uc}}}} > 1\]

When  $0 > \sigma_A > \sigma_B$, the condition becomes

\[{\sigma _B} <  - {S_{uc}}\]

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under ductile Coulomb-Mohr criterion.}
  \label{fig: Coulomb-Mohr ductile safe zone}
\end{figure}

For design equations, incorporating the safety factor $N_s$, simply divide all strengths by the factor.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _A} > {S_{ut}} \hfill \\
    \frac{{{\sigma _A}}}{{{S_{ut}}}} - \frac{{{\sigma _B}}}{{{S_{uc}}}} > 1 \hfill \\
    {\sigma _B} <  - \frac{{{S_{uc}}}}{{{N_s}}} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Maximum principal stress theory}

Also called \emph{Rankine’s criterion} or \emph{maximum normal stress criterion}, it states that yielding begins at a point in a member where the maximum principal stress reaches a value equal to the tensile yield stress $S_{ut}$. For example, assume that a nonzero principal stress acts at a point in the member. According to this criterion, yielding will occur when $\sigma_1$ or $\sigma_2$ reaches the value $S_{ut}$. If the material is subjected to plane stress, we require that

\[\begin{gathered}
    \left| {{\sigma _1}} \right| \leqslant {S_{ut}} \hfill \\
    \left| {{\sigma _2}} \right| \leqslant {S_{uc}} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered} \]

These equations are shown graphically in \cref{fig: MNST safe zone}. It is seen that if the stress coordinate at a point in the material falls on the boundary or outside the shaded area, the material is said to fracture.

  \caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under maximum principal stress criterion.}
  \label{fig: MNST safe zone}
\end{figure}

Experimentally, the criterion has been found to be in close agreement with the behavior of brittle materials that have strain diagrams that are similar in both tension and compression. The safety factor according to the criterion can be expressed in design equations as

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    {\sigma _1} > \frac{{{S_{ut}}}}{{{N_s}}} \hfill {\text{for }}{\sigma _1} > {\sigma _2} > 0 \\
    {\sigma _1} > \frac{{{S_{ut}}}}{{{N_s}}}{\text{ and }}{\sigma _2} <  - \frac{{{S_{uc}}}}{{{N_s}}} \hfill {\text{ for }}{\sigma _1} > 0 > {\sigma _2} \\
    {\sigma _2} <  - \frac{{{S_{uc}}}}{{{N_s}}} \hfill {\text{for }}{\sigma _2} < {\sigma _1} < 0 \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Modified Coulomb-Mohr theory}

Over the years, various empirical theories have been proposed to modify the basic failure theories. Coulomb-Mohr theory was proposed to predict fracture in brittle materials for which compressive strength is much greater than tensile strength. The failure condition is identical to that of ductile Coulomb-Mohr theory. However, there are still discrepancies between the condition and experimental results. The theory, consequently, is slightly modified to better accommodate the results.

The modified Coulomb-Mohr theory failure condition can be expressed as

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    {\sigma _A} < \frac{S_{ut}}{N_s} \hspace{2.5cm} &{\text{for }} \left\{
    \begin{gathered}
      {{\sigma _A} > {\sigma _B} > 0} \\ 
      {{\sigma _A} > 0 > {\sigma _B}{\text{ and }}\left| {\dfrac{\sigma _B}{\sigma _A}} \right| > 1} 
    \end{gathered} \right. \\
    \frac{{({S_{uc}} - {S_{ut}}){\sigma _A}}}{{{S_{uc}}{S_{ut}}}} - \frac{{{\sigma _B}}}{{{S_{uc}}}} > \frac{1}{{{N_s}}} \hspace{1cm} &{\text{for }}{\sigma _A} > 0 > {\sigma _B}\;{\text{and }}\left| {\frac{{{\sigma _B}}}{{{\sigma _A}}}} \right| > 1 \\
    {\sigma _B} <  - \frac{{{S_{uc}}}}{{{N_s}}} \hspace{2.2cm} &{\text{for }} 0 > {\sigma _A} > {\sigma _B} \\ 
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}                                                                               
The failure condition diagram for the theory is illustrated in \cref{fig: MCM safe zone}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under modified Coulomb-Mohr criterion.}
  \label{fig: MCM safe zone}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Criterion selection}

With an exception of a few, most ductile materials have the same tensile and compressive yield strengths. Therefore, \emph{maximum distortion energy theory} should be applicable. It is also more convenient than other maximum shear stress theory in that one mathematical expression applies to all states of stress regardless of the signs of the principal stresses.
For brittle materials, \emph{modified Coulomb-Mohr theory} shows the best fit to most experimental results and should be applied.

\section{Fatigue} \label{section: fatigue failure}

Fatigue has been defined as “the progressive localized permanent structural change that occurs in a material subjected to repeated or fluctuating strains at stresses having a maximum value less than the tensile strength of the material” (ASM, 1975). Fracture of a structural member as a result of repeated cycles of load or fluctuating loads in commonly referred to as a fatigue fracture or fatigue failure. The corresponding number of load cycles or the time during which the member is subjected to these loads before fracture occurs is referred to as the fatigue life.

The type of fatigue failure can be categorized base on the number of cycles before failure, $N$: high cycle fatigue for $N > 10^7$ cycles and low cycle fatigue for $N < 10^7$ cycles. High cycle fatigue is characterized by small elastic strains and can be captured by stress-based parameters. Low cycle fatigue, on the other hand, is characterized by large plastic strains and is captured by strain-based parameters.
To simplify the problem of fatigue failure, we can assume that the repeated loading causes the internal stress in the material to take a sinusoidal form, i.e.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    %\draw[very thin,color=gray] (-0.1,-1.1) grid (3.9,3.9);
    \draw[<->] (-5,0) -- (5,0) node[right] {$t$}; 
    \draw[<->] (0,-1) -- (0,2) node[above] {$\sigma$};

    %\draw[color=orange] plot (\x,{0.05*exp(\x)}) node[right] {$f(x) = \frac{1}{20} \mathrm e^x$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

where $f$ is the frequency of the load, $\sigma_a$ is the stress amplitude, and $\sigma_m$ is the mean stress.
When testing for material fatigue, it is common to test for the relationship between the exerted stress and the number of cycles before the specimen fails. This \emph{endurance} graph or $S-N$ graph, normally shows that as the alternating stress amplitude increases, the number of cycle the material can take before failure decreases. Some materials exhibit endurance limits--lower limits of stress amplitudes under which the materials no longer exhibit fatigue fracture. For other materials that do not exhibit endurance limits, it is customary to define the stresses to cause failure under a given number of cycle, say $N = 10^7$, as the \emph{endurance limit} or \emph{fatigue strength}, $S_e$.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A typical endurance diagram showing stress amplitude $\sigma_a$ vs number of cycles to failure $N$.}
  \label{fig: S-N diagram}
\end{figure}

Typically, steel exhibit this endurance limit. However, many aluminum alloys do not; beyond $10^7$ cycles, the required stress amplitude to cause fatigue keeps decreasing. This is why these aluminum alloys, though lighter than steel, still cannot replace steel in most rotational machinery.

\subsection{Fatigue under zero mean stress}

When the load is completely reversed, resulting in zero mean stress ($\sigma_m = 0$), fatigue failure can mostly be described by stress amplitude. At the lower end of this spectrum where the number of cycles to failure $N = 10^3$, the stress amplitude that leads to failure is called the \emph{low cycle fatigue limit}, $S_l$, and can be approximated as

\begin{equation}
  S_l = \left\{
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
    \begin{array}{ll}
      0.9 S_{ut} &\text{ for bending} \\
      0.75 S_{ut} &\text{ for axial} \\
      0.72 S_{ut} &\text{ for torsion}
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}

On the far end of the spectrum where $N = 10^7$, the stress amplitude is the \emph{endurance limit}, $S_e$, which can be approximated as

\begin{equation}
  S_e = \left\{
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
    \begin{array}{ll}
      0.5 S_{ut} & \text{ for bending} \\
      0.45 S_{ut} &\text{ for axial} \\
      0.29 S_{ut} &\text{ for torsion}
      \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}

For stress amplitude between the two ends, the expected number of cycles, $N$, can be interpolated. The relationship between them can be written as

\begin{equation}
  {\sigma _a} = 10^cN^b
\end{equation}

where $c$ and $b$ are parameters that can be obtained from

\begin{align*}
  b &= - \frac{1}{3} \log \dfrac{S_l}{S_e} \\
  c &= \log \dfrac{S_l^2}{S_e}
\end{align*}

Parameter $b$ is between $-0.06$ to $-0.14$ for most metals.

\subsection{Fatigue under nonzero mean stress}

Nonzero mean stresses have a significant effect on the fatigue strength of a material. There have been several relations proposed to describe the effects of mean stress. Three of such relations are
\begin{enumerate}
\item Soderberg relation

  \begin{equation}
    \frac{{{\sigma _a}}}{{{S_e}}} + \frac{{{\sigma _m}}}{{{S_y}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_s}}}
  \end{equation}

\item Gerber relation

  \begin{equation}
    \frac{{{\sigma _a}}}{{{S_e}}} + {\left( {\frac{{{\sigma _m}}}{{{S_{ut}}}}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{{{N_s}}}
  \end{equation}

\item Goodman relation

  \begin{equation}
    \frac{{{\sigma _a}}}{{{S_e}}} + \frac{{{\sigma _m}}}{{{S_{ut}}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_s}}}
  \end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

Where $\sigma_a$ is the stress amplitude, $S_e$ is the endurance limit, $S_y$ is the yield stress, $\sigma_m$ is the mean stress, and $S_{ut}$ is the ultimate tensile strength. For most metals, the Soderberg relation yields conservative estimates of critical stress amplitude. The Goodman relation gives reasonably good results for brittle materials, whereas it is conservative for ductile materials. The Gerber relation yields fairly good estimates for stress amplitude for ductile materials.

\begin{example} Fatigue failure of a rod under a periodic tensile load

  A cylindrical rod shall operate under a periodic tensile load as shown in the graph. Material of the rod is AISI1050 which has the following properties.
  Yield strength = 427 MPa
  Ultimate tensile strength = 748 MPa
  Modified endurance limit = 300 MPa
  Determine the suitable diameter of the rod. Use Soderberg line with $N_s$ = 3
\end{example}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{pictures/Failure-theories/fatigue-example}
  %\caption{'Safe-zone' diagram for material under modified Coulomb-Mohr criterion.}
  %\label{fig: fatigue example}
\end{figure}

\begin{solution}
  
  The safety factor of a member under alternate loading using the Soderberg line is as follows

  \[\frac{{{\sigma _a}}}{{{S_e}}} + \frac{{{\sigma _m}}}{{{S_y}}} = \frac{1}{{{N_s}}}\]

  The stress amplitude is simply the force amplitude divided by the cross sectional area of the rod.

  \[{\sigma _a} = \frac{{(8000 + 0)/2}}{{\frac{\pi }{4}{d^2}}} = \frac{{16000}}{{\pi {d^2}}}\]

  According to the Soderberg relation, we have

  \[\begin{gathered}
      \frac{{{\sigma _m}}}{{{S_y}}} + \frac{{{\sigma _a}}}{{{S_e}}} = \frac{1}{3} \\ 
      \dfrac{{\dfrac{{4000}}{{\dfrac{\pi }{4}{d^2}}}}}{{427 \times {{10}^6}}} + \dfrac{{\dfrac{{16000}}{{\pi {d^2}}}}}{{300 \times {{10}^6}}} = \frac{1}{3} \\ 
    \end{gathered} \]
  \[\begin{gathered}
      {d^2} = 6.29 \times {10^{ - 5}} \hfill \\
      d = 7.9 \times {10^{ - 3}} = 7.9 \text{ mm} \hfill \\ 
    \end{gathered} \]

  Therefore, the rod’s diameter must be 7.9 mm.
\end{solution}

\section{Buckling} \label{section: buckling}

Whenever a member is designed, it is necessary that it satisfy specific strength, deflection, and stability requirements. The previous chapters we have discussed some of the methods used to determine the member’s strength and deflection, while assuming that the member was always in stable equilibrium. Some members, however, may be subjected to compressive loads, which, if sufficiently large, can cause the member to deflect laterally. To be more specific, long slender members subjected to an axial compressive force are called columns, and the lateral deflection that occurs is called buckling. Buckling of a column can lead to a sudden and often disastrous failure of a structure or mechanism, and therefore special attention must be given to the design of columns to prevent such problems.

The maximum axial load that a column can support is called the critical load, $P_{cr}$. Any additional loading will cause the column to buckle and therefore deflect laterally. Depending on the supports of a column, the critical load can vary.

\subsection{Ideal column with pin supports}

In this section we will determine the critical buckling load for a column that is pin-supported. The column to be considered is an \emph{ideal column}, meaning one that is perfectly straight before loading, is made of homogeneous material, and upon which the load is applied through the centroid of the cross section.
When the critical load $P_{cr}$ is reached, the column is on the verge of becoming unstable, so that a small lateral force $F$ will cause the column to remain in the deflected position when $F$ is removed. Any slight reduction in the load $P$ from Pcr will allow the column to straighten out, and any slight increase in $P$ beyond $P_{cr}$ will cause further increases in lateral deflection.
Whether or not a column will remain stable or become unstable when subjected to an axial load will depend on its ability to restore itself, which is based on its resistance to bending. Therefore, to determine the critical load and the buckled shape of the column, we will apply the equation for beam bending,
\[EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} = M\]
Recall that this equation assumes that the slope of the curve is small and that deflections occur only by bending. When the column is in its deflected position, the internal bending moment can be determined by using the method of sections. The bending moment in the beam is simply the product of the compressive load $P$ and the maximum deflection in the middle $v$. Note that the bending moment is negative, according to the sign convention used to establish equation so that $M = -Pv$. Thus equation becomes

\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} =  - Pv \\
    \frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} + \left( {\frac{P}{{EI}}} \right)v = 0 \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

This is a homogeneous second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. The solution is of the form

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: gen solution}
  v = {C_1}\sin \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} x} \right) + {C_2}\cos \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} x} \right)
\end{equation}

Using the two boundary conditions that $v(x = 0) = 0$ and $v(x = L) = 0$, it can be determined that $C_2 = 0$ and

\[{C_1}\sin \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} L} \right) = 0\]

One way for this solution to be valid is for $C_1 = 0$, but this means that the column will remain straight since it leads to $v = 0$. This is a trivial solution and is not particularly interesting. The other, more interesting possibility is for 

\[\sin \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} L} \right) = 0\]

which is satisfied if

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: mode shape sub}
  \sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} L = n\pi
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}
  P = \frac{{{n^2}{\pi ^2}EI}}{{{L^2}}} \hspace{1cm}n = 1,2,3,...
\end{equation}

The smallest value of $P_r$ is obtained when $n = 1$, so the \emph{critical load} for the column is therefore

\begin{equation}
  {P_{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}EI}}{{{L^2}}}
\end{equation}

This load is sometimes referred to as the \emph{Euler load}.
For the corresponding buckling mode shapes, substitute the expression in equation \cref{eqn: mode shape sub} into \cref{eqn: gen solution} along with other solved parameters, we have

\[v = {C_2}\sin \frac{{n\pi x}}{L}\]

For purposes of design, this equation can also be written in a more useful form by expressing $I = Ar_g^2$, where $A$ is the cross-sectional area and $r_g$ is the \emph{radius of gyration} of the cross-sectional area. Thus,

\[\begin{gathered}
  {P_{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}E(A{r_g^2})}}{{{L^2}}} \\ 
  {\left( {\frac{P}{A}} \right)_{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}E}}{{{{(L/r_g)}^2}}} \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

or

\begin{equation}
  {\sigma _{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}E}}{{{{(L/r_g)}^2}}}
\end{equation}

The geometric ratio $L/r_g$ is known as the \emph{slenderness ratio}. It is a measure of the column’s flexibility.

\subsection{Columns having various types of supports}

In some other cases where the columns are supported in some other way, so that the column’s ends may be restricted against rotations or deflection in different ways, determination of the buckling load on the column follows the same procedure. Take, for example, a column whose one end is fixed while the other is free. Assume that the compressive load is exerted onto the free end. The internal bending moment at an arbitrary section, whose lateral deflection is v, is $M = P(\delta - v)$. The differential equation for the deflection curve is

\[\begin{gathered}
  EI\frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} = P(\delta - v) \\ 
  \frac{{{d^2}v}}{{d{x^2}}} + \frac{P}{{EI}}v = \frac{P}{{EI}}\delta  \\ 
\end{gathered} \]

Since this equation is nonhomogeneous, the solution consists of both a complementary and particular solutions.

\[v = {C_1}\sin \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} x} \right) + {C_2}\cos \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} x} \right) + \delta \]

Solving for constants of integration using $v(x = 0) = 0$ and $v(x = L) = \delta$, we have that

\[\delta \cos \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} L} \right) = 0\]

The nontrivial solution indicates that

\[\cos \left( {\sqrt {\frac{P}{{EI}}} L} \right) = 0 \hspace{0.5cm} \text{or} \hspace{0.5cm} \sqrt{\frac{P}{{EI}}} L = \frac{{n\pi }}{2}\]

The smallest critical load ($n = 1$) is

\[{P_{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}EI}}{{4{L^2}}}\]

By comparison, this critical load is a quarter of the critical load of a pin-supported column. Similar derivations can be used to determine the critical loads of those columns whose supports are different from the ones already given. For the case of a column having ends that are pinned or free to rotate, L represents the unsupported distance between the points of zero moment. For other types of supports, the column’s \emph{effective length}, $L_e$, can be used to represent that length and substituted into the critical load equation so that

\begin{equation} \label{eqn: Euler's formula}
  \begin{gathered}
    {P_{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}EI}}{{L_e^2}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}EI}}{{{{(KL)}^2}}} \hfill \\
    {\sigma _{cr}} = \frac{{{\pi ^2}E}}{{{{(KL/r_g)}^2}}} \hfill \\ 
  \end{gathered}
\end{equation}

where $L_e = KL$ in which $K$ is the \emph{effective-length factor} and $KL/r_g$ is the \emph{effective-slenderness ratio}. The table of $K$ values for various end supports is given below.

\begin{table}[h]

\section*{Summary}

In this final chapter, we studies various ways engineering materials can fail. The first two, yield/fracture and fatigue are due to damage inflicted to the material by stress. Buckling, on the other hand, is due to the geometric instability of the structure.

For yield and fracture, the failure is due to static load. Yield occurs usually in ductile materials, while fracture occurs in brittle materials. The criteria introduced can be used to determine ‘equivalent’ stress to determine whether yield or fracture will occur in case of multiaxial stress.

Fatigue is due to repeated or periodic loading. The size of the load itself is not sufficiently large to cause yield or fracture to the material immediately, but after several cycles, the cumulative damage can cause failure. We have derived equations relative the stress amplitude to the number of cycles before failure, which also depends on material properties and whether the average stress is zero.

Buckling occurs because the internal bending moment in the beam is not enough to counter the external bending moment caused by the axial compressive load if a slight lateral perturbation occurs. The critical axial load depends on the dimensions of the body, material properties, and support conditions.

\section*{Exercise}
